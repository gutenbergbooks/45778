</div></div>

<p>King Easter and King Wester were probably the petty princes
of Northumberland and Westmoreland. In the <i>Complaynt of
Scotland</i>, an ancient romance is mentioned, under the title,
"<i>How the king of Estmureland married the king's daughter of
Westmureland</i>," which may possibly be the original of the
beautiful legend of <i>King Estmere</i>, in the <i>Reliques of Ancient
English Poetry</i>, Vol. I. p. 62 4th edit. From this it may be
conjectured, with some degree of plausibility, that the independent
kingdoms of the east and west coast were, at an early period,
thus denominated, according to the Saxon mode of naming
districts, from their relative positions; as Essex, Wessex,
Sussex. But the geography of the metrical romances sets all
system at defiance; and in some of these, as <i>Clariodus</i> and
<i>Meliades</i>, Estmureland undoubtedly signifies the land of the
Easterlings, or the Flemish provinces at which vessels arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in three days from England, and to which they are represented
as exporting wool.&mdash;<i>Vide Notes on the Tale of Kempion.</i> On
this subject I have, since publication of the first edition, been
favoured with the following remarks by Mr Ritson, in opposition
to the opinion above expressed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Estmureland and Westmureland have no sort of relation
to Northumberland and Westmoreland. The former was
never called Eastmoreland, nor were there ever any kings of
Westmoreland; unless we admit the authority of an old
rhyme, cited by Usher:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here the king Westmer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Slow the king Rothinger."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There is, likewise, a 'king Estmere, of Spain,' in one of Percy's
ballads.</p>

<p>"In the old metrical romance of <i>Kyng Horn</i>, or <i>Horn Child</i>,
we find both Westnesse and Estnesse; and it is somewhat
singular, that two places, so called, actually exist in Yorkshire
at this day. But <i>ness</i>, in that quarter, is the name given
to an inlet from a river. There is, however, great confusion
in this poem, as <i>Horn</i> is called king sometimes of one country,
and sometimes of the other. In the French original,
Westir is said to have been the old name of Hirland, or Ireland;
which, occasionally at least, is called Westnesse, in the
translation, in which Britain is named Sudene; but here,
again, it is inconsistent and confused.</p>

<p>"It is, at any rate, highly probable, that the story, cited in
the <i>Complaynt of Scotland</i>, was a romance of <i>King Horn</i>,
whether prose or verse; and, consequently, that Estmureland
and Westmureland should there mean England and Ireland;
though it is possible that no other instance can be
found of those two names occurring with the same sense."</p>

<span class="i0"><i>And they cast kevils them amang.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>Kevils</i>&mdash;Lots. Both words originally meant only a portion,
or share, of any thing.&mdash;<i>Leges Burgorum</i>, cap. 59, <i>de lot, cut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>

fuerit confrater Gild&aelig;, &amp;c.</i> <i>Neque</i> lot <i>neque</i> cavil <i>habeat cum
aliquo confratre nostro.</i> In both these laws, <i>lot</i> and <i>cavil</i> signify
a share in trade.</p>

<p>This metaphorical language was customary among the northern
nations. In 925, king Adelstein sent an embassy to Harald
Harfagar, king of Norway, the chief of which presented
that prince with an elegant sword, ornamented with precious
stones. As it was presented by the point, the Norwegian chief,
in receiving it, unwarily laid hold of the hilt. The English ambassador
declared, in the name of his master, that he accepted
the act as a deed of homage; for, touching the hilt of a warrior's
sword was regarded as an acknowledgement of subjection.
The Norwegian prince, resolving to circumvent his rival by a
similar artifice, suppressed his resentment, and sent, next summer,
an embassy to Adelstein, the chief of which presented
Haco, the son of Harald, to the English prince; and, placing
him on his knees, made the following declaration:&mdash;"<i>Haraldus,
Normannorum rex, amice te salutat;</i> albamque <i>hunc
avem, bene institutam mittit, utque melius deinceps erudias,
postulat.</i>" The king received young Haco on his knees;
which the Norwegian ambassador immediately accepted, in
the name of his master, as a declaration of inferiority; according
to the proverb, "<i>Is minor semper habetur, qui alterius filium
educat.</i>"&mdash;Pontoppidani Vestigia Danor. Vol. II. p. 67.</p>

<h3><a name="KEMPION" id="KEMPION">KEMPION.</a></h3>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tale of <i>Kempion</i> seems, from the names of the personages,
and the nature of the adventure, to have been an
old metrical romance, degraded into a ballad, by the lapse
of time, and the corruption of reciters. The change in
the structure of the last verses, from the common ballad
stanza, to that which is proper to the metrical romance,
adds force to this conjecture.</p>

<p>Such transformations, as the song narrates, are common
in the annals of chivalry. In the 25th and 26th cantos of
the second book of the <i>Orlando Inamorato</i>, the paladin,
<i>Brandimarte</i>, after surmounting many obstacles, penetrates
into the recesses of an enchanted palace. Here he finds
a fair damsel, seated upon a tomb, who announces to him,
that, in order to achieve her deliverance, he must raise the
lid of the sepulchre, and kiss whatever being should issue
forth. The knight, having pledged his faith, proceeds to
open the tomb, out of which a monstrous snake issues forth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
with a tremendous hiss. <i>Brandimarte</i>, with much reluctance,
fulfils the <i>bizarre</i> conditions of the adventure; and
the monster is instantly changed into a beautiful Fairy, who
loads her deliverer with benefits. For the satisfaction of
those, who may wish to compare the tale of the Italian
poet with that of <i>Kempion</i>, a part of the original of Boiardo
is given below.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>There is a ballad, somewhat resembling <i>Kempion</i>, called
the <i>Laidley Worm of Spindleston-heuch</i>, which is very
popular upon the borders; but, having been often published,
it was thought unnecessary to insert it in this collection.
The most common version was either entirely composed,
or re-written, by the Reverend Mr Lamb, of Norham.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></div>

<p>A similar tradition is, by Heywood and Delrio, said to
have existed at Basil. A tailor, in an adventurous mood,
chose to descend into an obscure cavern, in the vicinity
of the city. After many windings, he came to an iron
door, through which he passed into a splendid chamber.
Here he found, seated upon a stately throne, a lady, whose
countenance was surprisingly beautiful, but whose shape
terminated in a dragon's train, which wrapped around the
chair on which she was placed. Before her stood a brazen
chest, trebly barred and bolted; at each end of which
lay couched a huge black ban-dog, who rose up, as if to
tear the intruder in pieces. But the lady appeased them;
and, opening the chest, displayed an immense treasure,
out of which she bestowed upon the visitor some small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
pieces of money, informing him, that she was enchanted
by her step-dame, but should recover her natural shape,
on being kissed thrice by a mortal. The tailor assayed
to fulfil the conditions of the adventure; but her face assumed
such an altered, wild, and grim expression, that his
courage failed, and he was fain to fly from the place. A
kinsman of his, some years after, penetrated into the cavern,
with the purpose of repairing a desperate fortune.
But, finding nothing but dead men's bones, he ran mad,
and died. Sir John Mandeville tells a similar story of a
Grecian island.</p>

<p>There are numerous traditions, upon the borders, concerning
huge and destructive snakes, and also of a poison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>ous
reptile called a <i>man-keeper</i>; although the common
adder, and blind worm, are the only reptiles of that <i>genus</i>
now known to haunt our wilds. Whether it be possible,
that, at an early period, before the country was drained,
and cleared of wood, serpents of a larger size may have
existed, is a question which the editor leaves to the naturalist.
But, not to mention the fabulous dragon, slain in
Northumberland by <i>Sir Bevis</i>, the fame still survives of
many a <i>preux chevalier</i>, supposed to have distinguished
himself by similar atchievements.</p>

<p>The manor of Sockburne, in the bishopric of Durham,
anciently the seat of the family of Conyers, or Cogniers,
is held of the bishop by the service of presenting, or showing
to him, upon his first entrance into his diocese, an an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>tique
sword, or faulchion. The origin of this peculiar service
is thus stated in Beckwith's edition of <i>Blount's Ancient
Tenures</i>, p. 200.</p>

<p>"Sir Edward Blackett (the proprietor of the manor)
now represents the person of Sir John Conyers, who, as
tradition says, in the fields of Sockburne, slew, with this
faulchion, a monstrous creature, a dragon, a worm, or
flying serpent, that devoured men, women, and children.
The then owner of Sockburne, as a reward for
his bravery, gave him the manor, with its appurtenances,
to hold for ever, on condition that he meets the lord
bishop of Durham, with this faulchion, on his first entrance
into his diocese, after his election to that see.</p>

<p>"And, in confirmation of this tradition, there is painted,
in a window of Sockburne church, the faulchion we
just now spoke of: and it is also cut in marble, upon the
tomb of the great ancestor of the Conyers', together
with a dog, and the monstrous worm, or serpent, lying
at his feet, of his own killing, of which the history of
the family gives the above account.</p>

<p>"When the bishop first comes into his diocese, he
crosses the river Tees, either at the ford at Nesham,
or Croft-bridge, where the counties of York and Durham
divide; at one of which places Sir Edward Blackett,
either in person, or by his representative, if the bishop
comes by Nesham, rides into the middle of the river
Tees, with the ancient faulchion drawn in his hand, or
upon the middle of Croft-bridge; and then presents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
faulchion to the bishop, addressing him in the ancient
form of words; upon which the bishop takes the faulchion
into his hand, looks at it, and returns it back
again, wishing the lord of the manor his health, and the
enjoyment of his estate." The faulchion, above alluded
to, has upon its hilt the arms of England, in the reign of
King John, and an eagle, supposed to be the ensign of
Morcar, earl of Northumberland.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gough's</span> <i>Camden's Britannia</i>,
Vol. III. p. 114. Mr Gough, with great appearance
of probability, conjectures, the dragon, engraved on
the tomb, to be an emblematical, or heraldric ornament.</p>

<p>The property, called Pollard's Lands, near Bishop Auckland,
is held by a similar tenure; and we are informed, in
the work just quoted, that "Dr Johnson of Newcastle met
the present bishop, Dr Egerton, in September, 1771, at
his first arrival there, and presented a faulchion upon
his knee, and addressed him in the old form of words,
saying,</p>

<p>"<i>My lord, in behalf of myself, as well as of the several
other tenants of Pollard's Lands, I do humbly present your
lordship with this faulchion, at your first coming here, wherewith,
as the tradition goeth, Pollard slew of old a great and
venomous serpent, which did much harm to man and beast:
and, by the performance of this service, these lands are
holden.</i>"&mdash;Ancient Tenures, p. 201.</p>

<p>Above the south entrance of the ancient parish church
of Linton, in Roxburghshire, is a rude piece of sculpture,
representing a knight, with a falcon on his arm, encoun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>tering
with his lance, in full career, a sort of monster,
which the common people call a <i>worm</i>, or snake. Tradition
bears, that this animal inhabited a den, or hollow, at
some distance from the church, whence it was wont to issue
forth, and ravage the country, or, by the fascination of its
eyes and breath, draw its prey into its jaws. Large rewards
were in vain offered for the destruction of this monster,
which had grown to so huge a bulk, that it used to
twist itself, in spiral folds, round a green hillock of considerable
height, still called Wormeston, and marked by a
clump of trees. When sleeping in this place, with its
mouth open, popular credulity affirms, that it was slain
by the laird of Lariston, a man, brave even to madness,
who, coming upon the snake at full gallop, thrust down
its throat a <i>peat</i> (a piece of turf dried for fuel), dipt in
scalding pitch, and fixed to the point of his lance. The
aromatic quality of the peat is said to have preserved the
champion from the effects of the monster's poisonous
breath, while, at the same time, it clogged its jaws. In
dying, the serpent contracted his folds with so much violence,
that their spiral impression is still discernible round
the hillock where it lay. The noble family of Somerville
are said to be descended from this adventurous knight, in
memory of whose atchievement, they bear a dragon as
their crest.</p>

<p>The sculpture itself gives no countenance to this fine
story; for the animal, whom the knight appears to be in
the act of slaying, has no resemblance to a serpent, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
rather to a wolf, or boar, with which the neighbouring
Cheviot mountains must in early times have abounded;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and there remain vestiges of another monster, of the same
species, attacking the horse of the champion. An inscription,
which might have thrown light upon this exploit,
is now totally defaced. The vulgar, adapting it to
their own tradition, tell us that it ran thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wode laird of Lariestoun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slew the wode worm of Wormiestoune,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wan all Linton paroschine.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is most probable, that the animal, destroyed by the
ancestor of Lord Somerville, was one of those beasts of
prey, by which Caledonia was formerly infested; but
which, now,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Razed out of all her woods, as trophies hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grin high emblazon'd on her children's shields.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Since publishing the first edition of this work, I have
found the following account of Somerville's atchievement,
in a MS. of some antiquity:</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></div>
<p>"John Somerville (son to Roger de Somerville, baron
of Whichenever, in Staffordshire) was made, by King
William (the Lion), his principal falconer, and got from
that king the lands and baronie of Linton, in Tiviotdale,
for an extraordinarie and valiant action; which, according
to the manuscript of the family of Drum, was thus:
In the parochen of Lintoun, within the sheriffdom of
Roxburgh, there happened to breed a monster, in form
of a serpent, or worme; in length, three Scots yards, and
somewhat bigger than an ordinarie man's leg, with a
head more proportionable to its length than greatness.
It had its den in a hollow piece of ground, a mile south-east
from Lintoun church; it destroyed both men and
beast that came in its way. Several attempts were made
to destroy it, by shooting of arrows, and throwing of
darts, none daring to approach so near as to make use
of a sword or lance. John Somerville undertakes to
kill it, and being well mounted, and attended with a
stout servant, he cam, before the sun-rising, before the
dragon's den, having prepared some long, small, and
hard peats (bog-turf dried for fuel), be-dabbed with pitch,
rosette, and brimstone, fixed with small wire upon a
wheel, at the point of his lance: these, being touched
with fire, would instantly break out into flames; and,
there being a breath of air, that served to his purpose,
about the sun-rising, the serpent, dragon, or worme, so
called by tradition, appeared with her head, and some
part of her body, without the den; whereupon his ser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>vant
set fire to the peats upon the wheel, at the top of
the lance, and John Somerville, advancing with a full
gallop, thrust the same with the wheel, and a great part
of the lance, directly into the serpent's mouthe, which
wente down its throat, into the belly, and was left there,
the lance breaking by the rebounding of the horse, and
giving a deadly wound to the dragoun; for which action
he was knighted by King William; and his effigies was
cut in ston in the posture he performed this actione, and
placed above the principal church door of Lintoun,
where it is yet to be seen, with his name and sirname:
and the place, where this monster was killed, is at this
day called, by the common people, who have the foresaid
story by tradition, the Wormes Glen. And further
to perpetuate this actione, the barons of Lintoun, Cowthally,
and Drum, did always carry for crest, a wheel,
and thereon a dragoun." Extracted from a genealogical
MS. in the Advocates' Library, written about 1680.
The falcon on the champion's arm, in the monument, may
be supposed to allude to his office of falconer to William
of Scotland.</p>

<p>The ballad of <i>Kempion</i> is given chiefly from Mrs Brown's
MS., with corrections from a recited fragment.</p>

our scene of action near Bamborough, and thereby almost identify
the tale of <i>Kempion</i> with that of the <i>Laidley Worm of Spindleston</i>,
to which it bears so strong a resemblance.</p>

<p>Our ideas of dragons and serpents are probably derived from
the Scandinavians. The legends of <i>Regnar Lodbrog</i>, and of
the huge snake in the Edda, by whose folds the world is encircled,
are well known. Griffins and dragons were fabled, by the
Danes, as watching over, and defending, hoards of gold.&mdash;<i>Bartholin.
de caus. cont. mortis</i>, p. 490. <i>Saxo Grammaticus</i>, lib. 2.
The Edda also mentions one Fafner, who, transformed into a
serpent, brooded over his hidden treasures. From these authorities,
and that of Herodotus, our Milton draws his simile&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Warwolf, or Lycanthropus, signifies a magician, possessing
the power of transforming himself into a wolf, for the purpose
of ravage and devastation. It is probable the word was first
used symbolically, to distinguish those, who, by means of intoxicating
herbs, could work their passions into a frantic state,
and throw themselves upon their enemies with the fury and temerity
of ravenous wolves. Such were the noted <i>Berserker</i>
of the Scandinavians, who, in their fits of voluntary frenzy, were
wont to perform the most astonishing exploits of strength, and
to perpetrate the most horrible excesses, although, in their natural
state, they neither were capable of greater crimes nor exertions
than ordinary men. This quality they ascribed to Odin.
"<i>Odinus efficere valuit, ut hostes ipsius inter bellandum c&aelig;ci
vel surdi vel attoniti fierent, armaque illorum instar baculorum
obtusa essent. Sui vero milites sine loricis incedebant, ac
instar</i> canum vel luporum furebant, <i>scuta sua arrodentes: et
robusti ut ursi vel tauri, adversarios trucidabant: ipsis vero
neque ignis neque ferrum nocuit. Ea qualitas vocatur furor
Berserkicus."&mdash;Snorro Sturleson,</i> quoted by <i>Bartholin. de
causis contempt&aelig; mortis</i>, p. 344. For a fuller account of
these frantic champions, see the <i>Hervorar Saga</i> published by
Suhm; also the <i>Christni Saga</i>, and most of the ancient Norwegian
histories and romances. Camden explains the tales of
the Irish, concerning men transformed into wolves, upon nearly
the same principle.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gough's</span> <i>edition of Camden's Britannia</i>,
Vol. III. p. 520.</p>

<p>But, in process of time, the transformation into a wolf was
believed to be real, and to affect the body as well as the mind;
and to such transformations our faithful Gervase of Tilbury
bears evidence, as an eye-witness. "<i>Vidimus frequenter in
Anglia per lunationes homines in lupos mutari, quod hominum
genus Gerulfos Galli vocunt, Angli vero</i> <span class="smcap">WER-WLF</span> <i>dicunt.</i>
<span class="smcap">Wer</span> <i>enim Anglice virum sonat,</i> <span class="smcap">WLF</span> <i>lupum." Ot.
Imp. De oculis apertis post peccatum.</i> The learned commentators,
upon the art of sorcery, differ widely concerning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
manner in which the arch fiend effects this change upon the
persons of his vassals; whether by surrounding their bodies
with a sort of pellice of condensed air, having the form of an
wolf; or whether by some delusion, affecting the eyes of the
spectators; or, finally, by an actual corporeal transformation.
The curious reader may consult <i>Delrii Disquisitiones Magic&aelig;</i>,
p. 188; and (if he pleases) Evvichius <i>de natura Sagarum</i>.&mdash;Fincelius,
<i>lib. 2. de Mirac.</i>&mdash;Remigius. <i>lib. 2. de D&aelig;monolat.</i>&mdash;Binsfeld.

Bodinus, Peucerus, Philippus Camerarius, Condronchus, Petrus
Thyr&aelig;us, Bartholomeus Spineus, Sir George Mackenzie, and
King James I., with the sapient Monsieur Oufle of Bayle. The
editor presumes, it is only since the extirpation of wolves, that
our British sorceresses have adopted the disguise of hares, cats,
and such more familiar animals.</p>

<p>A wild story of a warwolf, or rather a war-bear, is told in
Torf&oelig;us' History of Hrolfe Kraka. As the original is a scarce
book, little known in this country, some readers may be interested
by a short analysis of the tale.</p>

<p>Hringo, king of Upland, had an only son, called Biorno, the
most beautiful and most gallant of the Norwegian youth. At
an advanced period of life, the king became enamoured of a
"<i>witch lady</i>," whom he chose for his second wife. A mutual
and tender affection had, from infancy, subsisted betwixt Biorno,
and Bera, the lovely daughter of an ancient warrior. But
the new queen cast upon her step-son an eye of incestuous
passion; to gratify which, she prevailed upon her husband,
when he set out upon one of those piratical expeditions, which
formed the summer campaign of a Scandinavian monarch, to
leave the prince at home. In the absence of Hringo, she communicated
to Biorno her impure affection, and was repulsed
with disdain and violence. The rage of the weird step-mother
was boundless. "Hence to the woods!" she exclaimed, striking
the prince with a glove of wolf-skin; "Hence to the
woods! subsist only on thy father's herds; live pursuing, and
die pursued!" From this time the prince Biorno was no
more seen, and the herdsmen of the king's cattle soon obser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>ved,
that astonishing devastation was nightly made among their
flocks, by a black bear, of immense size, and unusual ferocity.
Every attempt to snare or destroy this animal was found vain;
and much was the unavailing regret for the absence of Biorno,
whose delight had been in extirpating beasts of prey. Bera,
the faithful mistress of the young prince, added her tears to the
sorrow of the people. As she was indulging her melancholy,
apart from society, she was alarmed by the approach of the
monstrous bear, which was the dread of the whole country.
Unable to escape, she waited its approach, in expectation of
instant death; when, to her astonishment, the animal fawned
upon her, rolled himself at her feet, and regarded her with eyes,
in which, spite of the horrible transformation, she still recognized
the glances of her lost lover. Bera had the courage
to follow the bear to his cavern, where, during certain hours,
the spell permitted him to resume his human shape. Her love
overcame her repugnance at so strange a mode of life, and she
continued to inhabit the cavern of Biorno, enjoying his society
during the periods of his freedom from enchantment. One day,
looking sadly upon his wife, "Bera," said the prince, "the end
of my life approaches. My flesh will soon serve for the repast
of my father and his courtiers. But, do thou beware
lest either the threats or entreaties of my diabolical step-mother
induce thee to partake of the horrid banquet. So shalt
thou safely bring forth three sons, who shall be the wonder
of the North." The spell now operated, and the unfortunate
prince sallied from his cavern to prowl among the herds. Bera
followed him, weeping, and at a distance. The clamour of the
chace was now heard. It was the old king, who, returned from
his piratical excursion, had collected a strong force to destroy
the devouring animal which ravaged his country. The poor
bear defended himself gallantly, slaying many dogs, and some
huntsmen. At length, wearied out, he sought protection at the
feet of his father. But his supplicating gestures were in vain,
and the eyes of paternal affection proved more dull than those
of love. Biorno died by the lance of his father, and his flesh
was prepared for the royal banquet. Bera was recognised, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
hurried into the queen's presence. The sorceress, as Biorno
had predicted, endeavoured to prevail upon Bera to eat of what
was then esteemed a regal dainty. Entreaties and threats being
in vain, force was, by the queen's command, employed for
this purpose, and Bera was compelled to swallow one morsel
of the bear's flesh. A second was put into her mouth, but she
had an opportunity of putting it aside. She was then dismissed
to her father's house. Here, in process of time, she was delivered
of three sons, two of whom were affected variously, in
person and disposition, by the share their mother had been compelled
to take in the feast of the king. The eldest, from his
middle downwards, resembled an elk, whence he derived the
name of Elgfrod. He proved a man of uncommon strength,
but of savage manners, and adopted the profession of a robber.
Thorer, the second son of Bera, was handsome and well shaped,
saving that he had the foot of a dog; from which he obtained
the appellation of Houndsfoot. But Bodvar, the third son, was
a model of perfection in mind and body. He revenged upon
the necromantic queen the death of his father, and became the
most celebrated champion of his age.</p>

<p class="center">NOW</p>

<p class="center">FIRST PUBLISHED IN A PERFECT STATE.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>This ballad is now, for the first time, published in a perfect
state. A fragment, comprehending the 2d, 4th, 5th,
and 6th verses, as also the 17th, has appeared in several
collections. The present copy is chiefly taken from the
recitation of an old woman, residing near Kirkhill, in West
Lothian; the same from whom were obtained the variations
in the tale of <i>Tamlane</i>, and the fragment of the <i>Wife
of Usher's Well</i>, which is the next in order.</p>

<p>The tale is much the same with the Breton romance,
called <i>Lay le Frain</i>, or the <i>Song of the Ash</i>. Indeed, the
editor is convinced, that the farther our researches are extended,
the more we shall see ground to believe, that the
romantic ballads of later times are, for the most part,
abridgments of the ancient metrical romances, narrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
in a smoother stanza, and more modern language. A copy
of the ancient romance, alluded to, is preserved in the
invaluable collection (W. 4. 1.) of the Advocates' Library,
and begins thus:</p>

THE WIFE OF USHER'S WELL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I wish the wind may never cease, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sense of this verse is obscure, owing, probably, to corruption
by reciters. It would appear, that the mother had sinned
in the same degree with the celebrated <i>Lenor&eacute;</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And their hats were o' the birk.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_46">46</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The notion, that the souls of the blessed wear garlands, seems
to be of Jewish origin. At least, in the <i>Maase-book</i>, there is a
Rabbinical tradition, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It fell out, that a Jew, whose name was Ponim, an ancient
man, whose business was altogether about the dead, coming
to the door of the school, saw one standing there, who had a
garland upon his head. Then was Rabbi Ponim afraid, imagining
it was a spirit. Whereupon he, whom the Rabbi saw,
called out to him, saying, 'Be not afraid, but pass forward.
Dost thou not know me?' Then said Rabbi Ponim, 'Art not
thou he whom I buried yesterday?' And he was answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
'Yea, I am he.' Upon which Rabbi Ponim said, 'Why comest
thou hither? How fareth it with thee in the other
world?' And the apparition made answer, 'It goeth well
with me, and I am in high esteem in paradise.' Then said
the Rabbi, 'Thou wert but looked upon in the world as an
insignificant Jew. What good work didst thou do, that thou
art thus esteemed?' The apparition answered, 'I will tell
thee: the reason of the esteem I am in, is, that I rose every
morning early, and with fervency uttered my prayer, and offered
the grace from the bottom of my heart: for which reason
I now pronounce grace in paradise, and am well respected.
If thou doubtest whether I am the person, I will show
thee a token that shall convince thee of it. Yesterday, when
thou didst clothe me in my funeral attire, thou didst tear my
sleeve.' Then asked Rabbi Ponim, 'What is the meaning
of that garland?' The apparition answered, 'I wear it, to the
end the wind of the world may not have power over me;
for it consists of excellent herbs of paradise.' Then did Rabbi
Ponim mend the sleeve of the deceased: for the deceased
had said, that if it was not mended, he should be ashamed
to be seen amongst others, whose apparel was whole. And
then the apparition vanished. Wherefore, let every one utter
his prayer with fervency; for then it shall go well with him
in the other world. And let care be taken that no rent, nor
tearing, be left in the apparel in which the deceased are interred."&mdash;<i>Jewish
Traditions, abridged from Buxtorf</i>, London,
1732, Vol. II. p. 19.</p>

<h3><a name="KING_HENRIE" id="KING_HENRIE">KING HENRIE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">THE ANCIENT COPY.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>This ballad is edited from the MS. of Mrs Brown, corrected
by a recited fragment. A modernized copy has
been published, under the title of "Courteous King Jamie."&mdash;<i>Tales
of Wonder</i>, Vol. II. p. 451.</p>

<p>The legend will remind the reader of the "Marriage of
Sir Gawain," in the <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>, and of the
"Wife of Bath's Tale," in Father Chaucer. But the
original, as appears from the following quotation from
Torf&oelig;us, is to be found in an Icelandic Saga:</p>

<p>"<i>Hellgius, Rex Dani&aelig;, m&oelig;rore ob amissam conjugem
vexatus, solus agebat, et subducens se hominum commercio,
segregem domum, omnis famulitii impatiens, incolebat. Accidit

addens id tanti referre, ut nisi impetraret, omnino sibi moriendum

<h3><a name="ANNAN_WATER" id="ANNAN_WATER">ANNAN WATER.</a></h3>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following verses are the original words of the tune of
"<i>Allan Water</i>," by which name the song is mentioned in
Ramsay's <i>Tea Table Miscellany</i>. The ballad is given from
tradition; and it is said, that a bridge, over the Annan,
was built in consequence of the melancholy catastrophe
which it narrates. Two verses are added in this edition,
from another copy of the ballad, in which the conclusion
proves fortunate. By the <i>Gatehope Slack</i>, is perhaps meant
the <i>Gate Slack</i>, a pass in Annandale. The Annan, and
the Frith of Solway, into which it falls, are the frequent
scenes of tragical accidents. The editor trusts he will be
pardoned for inserting the following awfully impressive
account of such an event, contained in a letter from Dr
Currie, of Liverpool, by whose correspondence, while in
the course of preparing these volumes for the press, he
has been alike honoured and instructed. After stating,
that he had some recollection of the ballad which follows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the biographer of Burns proceeds thus: "I once in my
early days heard (for it was night, and I could not see)
a traveller drowning; not in the Annan itself, but in the
Frith of Solway, close by the mouth of that river. The
influx of the tide had unhorsed him, in the night, as he
was passing the sands from Cumberland. The west
wind blew a tempest, and, according to the common
expression, brought in the water, <i>three foot a-breast</i>.
The traveller got upon a standing net, a little way from
the shore. There he lashed himself to the post, shouting
for half an hour for assistance&mdash;till the tide rose over
his head! In the darkness of night, and amid the pauses
of the hurricane, his voice, heard at intervals, was exquisitely
mournful. No one could go to his assistance&mdash;no
one knew where he was&mdash;the sound seemed to proceed
from the spirit of the waters. But morning rose&mdash;the
tide had ebbed&mdash;and the poor traveller was found
lashed to the pole of the net, and bleaching in the
wind."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_CRUEL_SISTER" id="THE_CRUEL_SISTER">THE CRUEL SISTER.</a></h3>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>This ballad differs essentially from that which has been
published in various collections, under the title of <i>Binnorie</i>.
It is compiled from a copy in Mrs Brown's MSS.,
intermixed with a beautiful fragment, of fourteen verses,
transmitted to the editor by J. C. Walker, Esq. the ingenious
historian of the Irish bards. Mr Walker, at the
same time, favoured the editor with the following note:&mdash;"I
am indebted to my departed friend, Miss Brook, for
the foregoing pathetic fragment. Her account of it was
as follows: This song was transcribed, several years ago,
from the memory of an old woman, who had no recollection
of the concluding verses: probably the beginning
may also be lost, as it seems to commence abruptly."
The first verse and burden of the fragment run
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O sister, sister, reach thy hand!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hey ho, my Nanny, O;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you shall be heir of all my land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While the swan swims bonny, O.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></div>
<p>The first part of this chorus seems to be corrupted from
the common burden of <i>Hey, Nonny, Nonny</i>, alluded to in
the song, beginning, "<i>Sigh no more, ladye</i>." The chorus,
retained in this edition, is the most common and popular;
but Mrs Brown's copy bears a yet different burden, beginning
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There were twa sisters sat in a bour,<br /></span>

<h3><a name="THE_QUEENS_MARIE" id="THE_QUEENS_MARIE">THE QUEEN'S MARIE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>"In the very time of the General Assembly, there comes
to public knowledge a haynous murther, committed in
the court; yea, not far from the queen's lap: for a
French woman, that served in the queen's chamber, had
played the whore with the queen's own apothecary.&mdash;The
woman conceived and bare a childe, whom, with
common consent, the father and mother murthered; yet
were the cries of a new-borne childe hearde, searche
was made, the childe and the mother were both apprehended,
and so was the man and the woman condemned
to be hanged in the publicke street of Edinburgh.&mdash;The
punishment was suitable, because the crime was
haynous. But yet was not the court purged of whores
and whoredoms, which was the fountaine of such enormities;
for it was well known that shame hasted mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>riage
betwixt John Sempill, called the Dancer, and
Mary Leringston<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, sirnamed the Lusty. What bruit
the Maries, and the rest of the dancers of the court
had, the ballads of that age do witnesse, which we, for
modestie's sake, omit: but this was the common complaint
of all godly and wise men, that, if they thought
such a court could long continue, and if they looked for
no better life to come, they would have wished their
sonnes and daughters rather to have been brought up
with fiddlers and dancers, and to have been exercised
with flinging upon a floore, and in the rest that thereof
followes, than to have been exercised in the company
of the godly, and exercised in virtue, which, in that
court was hated, and filthenesse not only maintained,
but also rewarded; witnesse the abbey of Abercorne,
the barony of Auchvermuchtie, and divers others, pertaining
to the patrimony of the crown, given in heritage
to skippers and dancers, and dalliers with dames. This
was the beginning of the regiment of Mary, queen of
Scots, and these were the fruits that she brought forth of
France.&mdash;<i>Lord! look on our miseries! and deliver us from</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><i>the wickednesse of this corrupt court!</i>"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Knox</span>'s <i>History of
the Reformation</i>, p. 373-4.</p>

<p>Such seems to be the subject of the following ballad, as
narrated by the stern apostle of presbytery. It will readily
strike the reader, that the tale has suffered great alterations,
as handed down by tradition; the French waiting-woman
being changed into Mary Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the queen's apothecary,
into Henry Darnley. Yet this is less surprising,
when we recollect, that one of the heaviest of the queen's
complaints against her ill-fated husband, was his infidelity,
and that even with her personal attendants. I have been
enabled to publish the following complete edition of the
ballad, by copies from various quarters; that principally
used, was communicated to me, in the most polite manner,
by Mr Kirkpatricke Sharpe, of Hoddom, to whom I am
indebted for many similar favours.</p>

<h4>NOTES<br />

<span class="small">ON</span><br />

THE QUEEN'S MARIE.</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>When she cam to the Netherbow port.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>, v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Netherbow port was the gate which divided the city of
Edinburgh from the suburb, called the Canongate. It had
towers and a spire, which formed a fine termination to the
view from the Cross. The gate was pulled down, in one of
those fits of rage for indiscriminate destruction, with which the
magistrates of a corporation are sometimes visited.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Yestreen the queen had four Maries,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>The night she'll hae but three, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_93">93</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The queen's Maries were four young ladies of the highest families
in Scotland, who were sent to France in her train, and
returned with her to Scotland. They are mentioned by Knox,
in the quotation introductory to this ballad. Keith gives us their
names, p. 55. "The young queen, Mary, embarked at Dunbarton
for France, ... and with her went ..., and four
young virgins, all of the name of Mary, viz. Livingston, Fle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>ming,
Seaton, and Beatoun." The queen's Maries are mentioned
again by the same author, p. 288, and 291, in the note.
Neither Mary Livingston, nor Mary Fleming, are mentioned in
the ballad; nor are the Mary Hamilton, and Mary Carmichael,
of the ballad mentioned by Keith. But if this corps continued
to consist of young virgins, as when originally raised, it could
hardly have subsisted without occasional recruits; especially if
we trust our old bard, and John Knox.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangingindent"><i>From Mr</i> <span class="smcap">Herd</span>'s <i>MS., where the following Note is prefixed
to it</i>&mdash;"Copied from the mouth of a Milkmaid, 1771,
by W. L."</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was originally the intention of the Editor to have omitted
this ballad, on account of the disagreeable nature of
the subject. Upon consideration, however, it seemed a
fair sample of a certain class of songs and tales, turning
upon incidents the most horrible and unnatural, with
which the vulgar in Scotland are greatly delighted, and
of which they have current amongst them an ample store.
Such, indeed, are the subjects of composition in most nations,
during the early period of society; when the feelings,
rude and callous, can only be affected by the strongest
stimuli, and where the mind does not, as in a more refined
age, recoil, disgusted, from the means by which interest
has been excited. Hence incest, parricide&mdash;crimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
in fine, the foulest and most enormous, were the early
themes of the Grecian muse. Whether that delicacy,
which precludes the modern bard from the choice of such
impressive and dreadful themes, be favourable to the higher
classes of poetic composition, may perhaps be questioned;
but there can be little doubt, that the more important
cause of virtue and morality is advanced by this
exclusion. The knowledge, that enormities are not without
precedent, may promote, and even suggest, them.
Hence, the publication of the <i>Newgate Register</i> has been
prohibited by the wisdom of the legislature; having been
found to encourage those very crimes, of which it recorded
the punishment. Hence, too, the wise maxim of the
Romans, <i>Facinora ostendi dum puniantur, flagitia autem abscondi
debent</i>.</p>

<p>The ballad has a high degree of poetical merit.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_SOUTERS_OF_SELKIRK" id="THE_SOUTERS_OF_SELKIRK">THE SOUTERS OF SELKIRK.</a></h3>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>This little lyric piece, with those which immediately follow
in the collection, relates to the fatal battle of Flodden,
in which the flower of the Scottish nobility fell around
their sovereign, James IV.</p>

<p>The ancient and received tradition of the burgh of Selkirk
affirms, that the citizens of that town distinguished
themselves by their gallantry on that disastrous occasion.
Eighty in number, and headed by their town-clerk, they
joined their monarch on his entrance into England. James,
pleased with the appearance of this gallant troop, knighted
their leader, William Brydone, upon the field of battle,
from which few of the men of Selkirk were destined to return.
They distinguished themselves in the conflict, and
were almost all slain. The few survivors, on their return
home, found, by the side of Lady-Wood Edge, the corpse
of a female, wife to one of their fallen comrades, with a
child sucking at her breast. In memory of this latter
event, continues the tradition, the present arms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
burgh bear, a female, holding a child in her arms, and
seated on a sarcophagus, decorated with the Scottish lion;
in the back-ground a wood.</p>

<p>A learned antiquary, whose judgment and accuracy
claim respect, has made some observations upon the probability
of this tradition, which the editor shall take the
liberty of quoting, as an introduction to what he has to
offer upon the same subject. And, if he shall have the
misfortune to differ from the learned gentleman, he will
at least lay candidly before the public the grounds of his
opinion.</p>

<p>"That the souters of Selkirk should, in 1513, amount
to fourscore fighting men, is a circumstance utterly incredible.
It is scarcely to be supposed, that all the
shoemakers in Scotland could have produced such an
army, at a period when shoes must have been still less
worn than they are at present. Dr Johnson, indeed,
was told at Aberdeen, that the people learned the art of
making shoes from Cromwell's soldiers.&mdash;'The numbers,'
he adds, 'that go barefoot, are still sufficient to
show that shoes may be spared: they are not yet considered
as necessaries of life; for tall boys, not otherwise
meanly dressed, run without them in the streets;
and, in the islands, the sons of gentlemen pass several
of their first years with naked feet.'&mdash;(<i>Journey to the
Western Islands</i>, p. 55.) Away, then, with the fable of
the souters of Selkirk. Mr Tytler, though he mentions
it as the subject of a song, or ballad, 'does not remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>ber
ever to have seen the original genuine words,'&mdash;as
he obligingly acknowledged in a letter to the editor.
Mr Robertson, however, who gives the statistical account
of the parish of Selkirk, seems to know something
more of the matter&mdash;'Some,' says he, 'have <i>very falsely</i>
attributed to this event (the battle of Flowden), that
song,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Up wi' the souters of Selkirk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And down with the Earl of Hume.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There was no Earl of Hume,' he adds, 'at that time,
nor was this song composed till long after. It arose
from a bet betwixt the Philiphaugh and Hume families;
the souters (or shoemakers) of Selkirk, against the men
of Hume, at a match of foot-ball, in which the souters of
Selkirk completely gained, and afterwards perpetuated
their victory in that song.'&mdash;This is decisive; and so
much for Scottish tradition."&mdash;Note to <i>Historical Essay
on Scotish Song</i>, prefixed to <i>Scotish Songs</i> in 2 vols. 1794.</p>

<p>It is proper to remark, that the passage of Mr Robertson's
statistical account, above quoted, does not relate to
the authenticity of the tradition, but to the origin of the
song, which is obviously a separate and distinct question.
The entire passage in the statistical account (of which a
part only is quoted in the essay) runs thus:</p>

<p>"Here, too, the inhabitants of the town of Selkirk, who
breathed the manly spirit of real freedom, justly merit
particular attention. Of one hundred citizens, who fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>lowed
the fortunes of James IV. on the plains of Flowden,
a few returned, loaded with the spoils taken from
the enemy. Some of these trophies still survive the rust
of time, and the effects of negligence. The desperate
valour of the citizens of Selkirk, which, on that fatal day,
was eminently conspicuous to both armies, produced very
opposite effects. The implacable resentment of the
English reduced their defenceless town to ashes; while
their grateful sovereign (James V.) showed his sense of
their valour, by a grant of an extensive portion of the forest,
the trees for building their houses, and the property
as the reward of their heroism."&mdash;A note is added by
Mr Robertson.&mdash;"A standard, the appearance of which
bespeaks its antiquity, is still carried annually (on the
day of riding their common) by the corporation of weavers,
by a member of which it was taken from the English
in the field of Flowden. It may be added, that the
sword of William Brydone, the town clerk, who led the
citizens to the battle (and who is said to have been
knighted for his valour), is still in the possession of
John Brydon, a citizen of Selkirk, his lineal descendant."&mdash;An
additional note contains the passage quoted
in the <i>Essay on Scotish Song</i>.</p>

<p>If the testimony of Mr Robertson is to be received as
decisive of the question, the learned author of the essay
will surely admit, upon re-perusal, that the passage in the
statistical account contains the most positive and unequivocal
declaration of his belief in the tradition.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></div>

<p>Neither does the story itself, upon close examination,
contain any thing inconsistent with probability. The
towns upon the border, and especially Selkirk and Jedburgh,
were inhabited by a race of citizens, who, from
the necessity of their situation, and from the nature of
their possessions (held by burgage tenure), were inured
to the use of arms. Selkirk was a county town, and a
royal burgh; and when the array of the kingdom, amounting
to no less than one hundred thousand warriors, was
marshalled by the royal command, eighty men seems no
unreasonable proportion from a place of consequence, lying
so very near the scene of action.</p>

<p>Neither is it necessary to suppose, literally, that the
men of Selkirk were all <i>souters</i>. This appellation was obviously
bestowed on them, because it was the trade most
generally practised in the town, and therefore passed into
a general epithet. Even the existence of such a craft,
however, is accounted improbable by the learned essayist,
who seems hardly to allow, that the Scottish nation was,
at that period, acquainted with the art "of accommodating
their feet with shoes." And here he attacks us with
our own weapons, and wields the tradition of Aberdeen
against that of Selkirk. We shall not stop to enquire, in
what respect Cromwell's regiment of missionary cobblers
deserves, in point of probability, to take precedence of the
souters of Selkirk. But, allowing that all the shoemakers
in England, with <i>Praise-the-Lord Barebones</i> at their head,
had generously combined to instruct the men of Aber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>deen
in the arts of psalmody and cobbling, it by no means
bears upon the present question. If instruction was at all
necessary, it must have been in teaching the natives how
to make <i>shoes</i>, properly so called, in opposition to <i>brogues</i>:
For there were cordiners in Aberdeen long before Cromwell's
visit, and several fell in the battle of the bridge of
Dee, as appears from Spalding's <i>History of the Troubles in
Scotland</i>, Vol. II. p. 140. Now, the "single-soaled shoon,"
made by the souters of Selkirk, were a sort of brogues,
with a single thin soal; the purchaser himself performing
the further operation of sewing on another of thick leather.
The rude and imperfect state of this manufacture
sufficiently evinces the antiquity of the craft. Thus, the
profession of the citizens of Selkirk, instead of invalidating,
confirms the traditional account of their valour.</p>

<p>The total devastation of this unfortunate burgh, after the
fatal battle of Flodden, is ascertained by the charters under
which the corporation hold their privileges. The first
of these is granted by James V., and is dated 4th March,
1535-6. The narrative, or inductive clause of the deed,
is in these words: "<i>Sciatis quia nos considerantes et intelligentes

The charter proceeds, in common form, to erect anew the
town of Selkirk into a royal burgh, with all the privileges
annexed to such corporations. This mark of royal favour
was confirmed by a second charter, executed by the same
monarch, after he had attained the age of majority, and
dated April 8, 1538. This deed of confirmation first narrates
the charter, which has been already quoted, and then
proceeds to mention other grants, which had been conferred
upon the burgh, during the minority of James V., and
which are thus expressed: "We for the gude trew and
thankful service done and to be done to ws be owre lovittis

which all these deeds and letters of donation are engrossed,
proceeds to ratify and confirm them in the most ample
manner. The testing clause, as it is termed in law
language, is in these words: "<i>In cujus rei Testimonium

<p>From these extracts, which are accurately copied from
the original charters,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> it may be safely concluded, 1st,
that Selkirk was a place of importance before it was ruined
by the English; and, 2d, "that the voice of merchants
had ceased in her streets," in consequence of the fatal
field of Flodden. But further, it seems reasonable to infer,
that so many marks of royal favour, granted within
so short a time of each other, evince the gratitude, as well
as the compassion, of the monarch, and were intended to
reward the valour, as well as to relieve the distress, of the
men of Selkirk. Thus, every circumstance of the written
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>evidence, as far as it goes, tallies with the oral tradition
of the inhabitants; and, therefore, though the latter
may be exaggerated, it surely cannot be dismissed as entirely
void of foundation. That William Brydone actually
enjoyed the honour of knighthood, is ascertained by
many of the deeds, in which his name appears as a notary
public. John Brydone, lineal descendant of the gallant
town-clerk, is still alive, and possessed of the reliques
mentioned by Mr Robertson. The old man, though in an
inferior station of life, receives considerable attention from
his fellow-citizens, and claims no small merit to himself on
account of his brave ancestor.</p>

<p>Thus far concerning the tradition of the exploits of the
men of Selkirk, at Flodden field. Whether the following
verses do, or do not, bear any allusion to that event, is a
separate and less interesting question. The opinion of
Mr Robertson, referring them to a different origin, has
been already mentioned; but his authority, though highly
respectable, is not absolutely decisive of the question.</p>

<p>The late Mr Plummer, sheriff-depute of the county of
Selkirk, a faithful and accurate antiquary, entertained a
very opposite opinion. He has thus expressed himself,
upon the subject, in the course of his literary correspondence
with Mr Herd:</p>

<p>"Of the Souters of Selkirk, I never heard any words
but the following verse:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Up with the Sutors of Selkirk,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'And down wi' the Earl of Home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And up wi' a' the bra' lads<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'That sew the single-soled shoon.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It is evident, that these words cannot be so ancient as
to come near the time when the battle was fought; as
Lord Home was not created an earl till near a century
after that period.</p>

<p>"Our clergyman, in the "Statistical Account," Vol. II.
p. 48, note, says, that these words were composed upon
a match at foot-ball, between the Philiphaugh and Home
families. I was five years at school at Selkirk, have
lived all my days within two miles of that town, and
never once heard a tradition of this imaginary contest
till I saw it in print.</p>

<p>"Although the words are not very ancient, there is
every reason to believe, that they allude to the battle of
Flodden, and to the different behaviour of the souters,
and Lord Home, upon that occasion. At election dinners,
&amp;c. when the Selkirk folks begin to get <i>fou'</i>, (merry)
they always call for music, and for that tune in particular.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
At such times I never heard a souter hint at
the foot-ball, but many times speak of the battle of
"Flodden."&mdash;<i>Letter from Mr Plummer to Mr Herd, 13th
January, 1793.</i></p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></div>
<p>The editor has taken every opportunity, which his situation<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
has afforded him, to obtain information on this
point, and has been enabled to recover two additional
verses of the song.</p>

<p>The yellow and green, mentioned in the second verse,
are the liveries of the house of Home. When the Lord
Home came to attend the governor, Albany, his attendants
were arrayed in Kendal-green.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Godscroft.</span></p>

THE SOUTERS OF SELKIRK.</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is unnecessary here to enter into a formal refutation of
the popular calumny, which taxed Lord Home with being the
murderer of his sovereign, and the cause of the defeat at Flodden.
So far from exhibiting any marks of cowardice or disaffection,
the division, headed by that unfortunate nobleman,
was the only part of the Scottish army which was conducted
with common prudence on that fatal day. This body formed
the vanguard, and entirely routed the division of Sir Edmund
Howard, to which they were opposed; but the reserve of the
English cavalry rendered it impossible for Home, notwithstanding
his success, to come to the aid of the king, who was irretrievably
ruined by his own impetuosity of temper.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pinkerton's</span>
<i>History</i>, Vol II. p. 105. The escape of James from the field
of battle, has been long deservedly ranked with that of King
Sebastian, and similar <i>speciosa miracula</i> with which the vulgar
have been amused in all ages. Indeed, the Scottish nation
were so very unwilling to admit any advantage on the English
part, that they seem actually to have set up pretensions to the
victory.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The same temper of mind led them eagerly to
ascribe the loss of their monarch, and his army, to any caus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>e,
rather than to his own misconduct, and the superior military
skill of the English. There can be no doubt, that James actually
fell on the field of battle, the slaughter-place of his nobles.&mdash;<i>Pinkerton,
ibid.</i> His dead body was interred in the
monastery of Sheen, in Surrey; and Stowe mentions, with regard
to it, the following degrading circumstances.</p>

<p>"After the battle, the bodie of the said king, being found,
was closed in lead, and conveyed from thence to London,
and to the monasterie of Sheyne, in Surry, where it remained
for a time, in what order I am not certaine; but, since
the dissolution of that house, in the reigne of Edward VI.,
Henry Gray, Duke of Norfolke, being lodged, and keeping
house there, I have been shewed the same bodie, so lapped
in lead, close to the head and bodie, throwne into a waste
room, amongst the old timber, lead, and other rubble. Since
the which time, workmen there, for their foolish pleasure,
hewed off his head; and Lancelot Young, master glazier to
Queen Elizabeth, feeling a sweet savour to come from thence,
and seeing the same dried from all moisture, and yet the
form remaining, with haire of the head, and beard red,
brought it to London, to his house in Wood-street, where,
for a time, he kept it, for its sweetness, but, in the end,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>caused the sexton of that church (St Michael's, Wood-street)
to bury it amongst other bones taken out of their charnell."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stowe's</span>

he wrote his statistical account of the parish of Selkirk; for it appears,
that, instead of a grant of lands, the privilege granted to the
community was a right of tilling one thousand acres of those which
already belonged to the burgh. Hence it follows, that, previous to
the field of Flodden, the town must have been possessed of a spacious
domain, to which a thousand acres in tillage might bear a due
proportion. This circumstance ascertains the antiquity and power
of the burgh; for, had this large tract of land been granted during
the minority of James V., the donation, to be effectual, must have
been included in the charters of confirmation.</p></div>

<h3><a name="THE_FLOWERS_OF_THE_FOREST" id="THE_FLOWERS_OF_THE_FOREST">THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST.</a><br />

PART FIRST.</h3>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following well known, and beautiful stanzas, were
composed many years ago, by a lady of family, in Roxburghshire.
The manner of the ancient minstrels is so
happily imitated, that it required the most positive evidence
to convince the editor that the song was of modern date.
Such evidence, however, he has been able to procure;
having been favoured, through the kind intervention of
Dr Somerville (well known to the literary world, as the
historian of King William, &amp;c.), with the following authentic
copy of the <i>Flowers of the Forest</i>.</p>

<p>From the same respectable authority, the editor is enabled
to state, that the tune of the ballad is ancient, as well
as the two following lines of the first stanza:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've heard them lilting at the ewes milking,<br /></span>
<span class="i0" style="letter-spacing:2em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0" style="letter-spacing:2em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowers of the forest are a' wede away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some years after the song was composed, a lady, who
is now dead, repeated to the author another imperfect line
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> the original ballad, which presents a simple and affecting
image to the mind:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I ride single on my saddle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For the flowers of the forest are a' wede away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first of these trifling fragments, joined to the remembrance
of the fatal battle of Flodden (in the calamities
accompanying which, the inhabitants of Ettrick Forest
suffered a distinguished share), and to the present solitary
and desolate appearance of the country, excited, in the
mind of the author, the ideas, which she has expressed in
a strain of elegiac simplicity and tenderness, which has
seldom been equalled.</p>

<p>These lines have been said to contain an anachronism; the
supposed date of the lamentation being about the period of the
field of Flodden. The editor can see no ground for this charge.
Fairs were held in Scotland from the most remote antiquity;
and are, from their very nature, scenes of pleasure and gallantry.
The preachings of the friars were, indeed, professedly,
meetings for a graver purpose; but we have the authority
of the <i>Wife of Bath</i> (surely most unquestionable in such a
point), that they were frequently perverted to places of rendezvous:</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FLOWERS_OF_THE_FOREST2" id="THE_FLOWERS_OF_THE_FOREST2">THE FLOWERS OF THE FOREST.</a><br />

PART SECOND.</h3>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following verses, adapted to the ancient air of the
<i>Flowers of the Forest</i>, are, like the elegy which precedes
them, the production of a lady. The late Mrs Cockburn,
daughter of Rutherford of Fairnalie, in Selkirkshire, and
relict of Mr Cockburn of Ormiston (whose father was lord justice-clerk
of Scotland), was the authoress. Mrs Cockburn
has been dead but a few years. Even at an age, advanced
beyond the usual bounds of humanity, she retained
a play of imagination, and an activity of intellect,
which must have been attractive and delightful in youth,
but was almost preternatural at her period of life. Her
active benevolence, keeping pace with her genius, rendered
her equally an object of love and admiration. The
editor, who knew her well, takes this opportunity of doing
justice to his own feelings; and they are in unison with
those of all who knew his regretted friend.</p>

<p>The verses, which follow, were written at an early period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of life, and without peculiar relation to any event,
unless it were the depopulation of Ettrick Forest.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Under the vigorous administration of James IV. the young
Earl of Caithness incurred the penalty of outlawry and forfeiture,
for revenging an ancient feud. On the evening preceding
the battle of Flodden, accompanied by 300 young warriors,
arrayed in green, he presented himself before the king,
and submitted to his mercy. This mark of attachment was so
agreeable to that warlike prince, that he granted an immunity
to the Earl and all his followers. The parchment, on which
this immunity was inscribed, is said to be still preserved in the
archives of the earls of Caithness, and is marked with the
drum-strings, having been cut out of a drum-head, as no other
parchment could be found in the army. The Earl, and his gallant
band, perished to a man in the battle of Flodden; since
which period, it has been reckoned unlucky in Caithness <i>to
wear green</i>, or <i>cross the Ord on a Monday</i>, the day of the week
on which the chieftain advanced into Sutherland.</p>

<p>In the border counties of Scotland, it was formerly customary,
when any rancorous enmity subsisted between two clans,
to leave the right hand of male children unchristened, that it
might deal the more deadly, or, according to the popular
phrase, "unhallowed" blows, to their enemies. By this superstitious
rite, they were devoted to bear the family feud, or enmity.
The same practice subsisted in Ireland, as appears from
the following passage in <i>Campion's History of Ireland</i>, published
in 1633. "In some corners of the land they used a
damnable superstition, leaving the right armes of their infants,
males, unchristened (as they termed it), to the end
it might give a more ungracious and deadly blow." P. <a href="#Page_15">15</a>.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Popular superstition in Scotland still retains so formidable
an idea of the <i>guilt of blood</i>, that those ancient edifices, or castles,
where enormous crimes have been committed, are supposed
to sink gradually into the ground. With regard to the castle
of Hermitage, in particular, the common people believe,
that thirty feet of the walls sunk, thirty feet fell, and thirty
feet remain standing.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The fatal battle of the standard was fought on Cowton
Moor, near Northallerton (A.S. Ealfertun), in Yorkshire, 1138.
David I. commanded the Scottish army. He was opposed by
Thurston, archbishop of York, who, to animate his followers,
had recourse to the impressions of religious enthusiasm. The
mast of a ship was fitted into the perch of a four-wheeled carriage;
on its top was placed a little casket, containing a consecrated
host. It also contained the banner of St Cuthbert,
round which were displayed those of St Peter of York, St
John of Beverly, and St Wilfred of Rippon. This was the English
standard, and was stationed in the centre of the army.
Prince Henry, son of David, at the head of the men of arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
chiefly from Cumberland and Teviotdale, charged, broke, and
completely dispersed, the centre; but unfortunately was not
supported by the other divisions of the Scottish army. The
expression of Aldred (p. 345), describing this encounter, is
more spirited than the general tenor of monkish historians;&mdash;"<i>Ipsa
globi australis parte, instar cassis arane&aelig; dissipata</i>"&mdash;that
division of the phalanx was dispersed like a cobweb.</p>

<h3><a name="CHRISTIES_WILL" id="CHRISTIES_WILL">CHRISTIE'S WILL.</a></h3>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the reign of Charles I., when the moss-trooping practices
were not entirely discontinued, the tower of Gilnockie,
in the parish of Cannoby, was occupied by William
Armstrong, called, for distinction's sake, <i>Christie's Will</i>, a
lineal descendant of the famous John Armstrong, of Gilnockie,
executed by James V.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The hereditary love of
plunder had descended to this person with the family mansion;
and, upon some marauding party, he was seized, and
imprisoned in the tolbooth of Jedburgh. The Earl of Traquair,
lord high treasurer, happening to visit Jedburgh,
and knowing Christie's Will, enquired the cause of his
confinement. Will replied, he was imprisoned for stealing
two <i>tethers</i> (halters); but, upon being more closely interrogated,
acknowledged, there were two <i>delicate colts</i> at
the end of them. The joke, such as it was, amused the
Earl, who exerted his interest, and succeeded in releasing
Christie's Will from bondage. Some time afterwards, a
law-suit, of importance to Lord Traquair, was to be decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>in the Court of Session; and there was every reason
to believe, that the judgment would turn upon the voice of
the presiding judge, who has a casting vote, in case of an
equal division among his brethren. The opinion of the
president was unfavourable to Lord Traquair; and the
point was, therefore, to keep him out of the way, when
the question should be tried. In this dilemma, the Earl
had recourse to Christie's Will; who, at once, offered his
service, to kidnap the president. Upon due scrutiny, he
found it was the judge's practice frequently to take the
air, on horseback, on the sands of Leith, without an attendant.
In one of these excursions, Christie's Will, who had
long watched his opportunity, ventured to accost the president,
and engage him in conversation. His address and
language were so amusing, that he decoyed the president
into an unfrequented and furzy common, called the Frigate
Whins, where, riding suddenly up to him, he pulled
him from his horse, muffled him in a large cloak, which
he had provided, and rode off, with the luckless judge
trussed up behind him. Will crossed the country with
great expedition, by paths, only known to persons of his
description, and deposited his weary and terrified burden
in an old castle, in Annandale, called the Tower of
Graham.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The judge's horse being found, it was concluded
he had thrown his rider into the sea; his friends went
into mourning, and a successor was appointed to his office.
Meanwhile, the poor president spent a heavy time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>in the vault of the castle. He was imprisoned, and solitary;
receiving his food through an aperture in the wall,
and never hearing the sound of a human voice, save when
a shepherd called his dog, by the name of <i>Batty</i>, and when
a female domestic called upon <i>Maudge</i>, the cat. These,
he concluded, were invocations of spirits; for he held
himself to be in the dungeon of a sorcerer. At length, after
three months had elapsed, the law-suit was decided in
favour of Lord Traquair; and Will was directed to set the
president at liberty. Accordingly, he entered the vault,
at dead of night, seized the president, muffled him once
more in the cloak, without speaking a single word, and,
using the same mode of transportation, conveyed him to
Leith sands, and set down the astonished judge on the
very spot where he had taken him up. The joy of his
friends, and the less agreeable surprise of his successor,
may be easily conceived, when he appeared in court, to
reclaim his office and honours. All embraced his own
persuasion, that he had been spirited away by witchcraft;
nor could he himself be convinced of the contrary, until,
many years afterwards, happening to travel in Annandale,
his ears were saluted, once more, with the sounds of
<i>Maudge</i> and <i>Batty</i>&mdash;the only notes which had solaced his
long confinement. This led to a discovery of the whole
story; but, in these disorderly times, it was only laughed
at, as a fair <i>ruse de guerre</i>.</p>

<p>Wild and strange as this tradition may seem, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
little doubt of its foundation in fact. The judge, upon
whose person this extraordinary stratagem was practised,
was Sir Alexander Gibson, Lord Durie, collector of the
reports, well known in the Scottish law, under the title of
<i>Durie's Decisions</i>. He was advanced to the station of an
ordinary lord of session, 10th July, 1621, and died, at his
own house of Durie, July 1646. Betwixt these periods his
whimsical adventure must have happened; a date which
corresponds with that of the tradition.</p>

<p>"We may frame," says Forbes, "a rational conjecture
of his great learning and parts, not only from his collection
of the decisions of the session, from July 1621 till
July 1642, but also from the following circumstances:
1. In a tract of more as twenty years, he was frequently
chosen vice-president, and no other lord in that time.
2. 'Tis commonly reported, that some party, in a considerable
action before the session, finding, that the Lord
Durie could not be persuaded to think his plea good,
fell upon a stratagem to prevent the influence and
weight, which his lordship might have to his prejudice,
by causing some strong masked men kidnap him, in the
links of Leith, at his diversion on a Saturday afternoon,
and transport him to some blind and obscure room in
the country, where he was detained captive, without the
benefit of day-light, a matter of three months (though
otherways civilly and well entertained); during which
time his lady and children went in mourning for him,
as dead. But, after the cause aforesaid was decided, the
Lord Durie was carried back by incognitos, and dropt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
in the same place where he had been taken up."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Forbes's</span>
<i>Journal of the Session</i>, Edin. 1714. <i>Preface</i>, p. 28.</p>

<p>Tradition ascribes to Christie's Will another memorable
feat, which seems worthy of being recorded. It is well
known, that, during the troubles of Charles I., the Earl
of Traquair continued unalterably fixed in his attachment
to his unfortunate master, in whose service he hazarded
his person, and impoverished his estate. It was
of consequence, it is said, to the king's service, that a
certain packet, containing papers of importance, should
be transmitted to him from Scotland. But the task was
a difficult one, as the parliamentary leaders used their utmost
endeavours to prevent any communication betwixt
the king and his Scottish friends. Traquair, in this
strait, again had recourse to the services of Christie's
Will; who undertook the commission, conveyed the papers
safely to his majesty, and received an answer, to be
delivered to Lord Traquair. But, in the mean time, his
embassy had taken air, and Cromwell had dispatched
orders to intercept him at Carlisle. Christie's Will, unconscious
of his danger, halted in the town to refresh his
horse, and then pursued his journey. But, as soon as he
began to pass the long, high, and narrow bridge, which
crosses the Eden at Carlisle, either end of the pass was
occupied by a party of parliamentary soldiers, who were
lying in wait for him. The borderer disdained to resign
his enterprise, even in these desperate circumstances; and
at once forming his resolution, spurred his horse ov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>er the
parapet. The river was in high flood. Will sunk&mdash;the
soldiers shouted&mdash;he emerged again, and, guiding his
horse to a steep bank, called the Stanners, or Stanhouse,
endeavoured to land, but ineffectually, owing to his heavy
horseman's cloak, now drenched in water. Will cut the
loop, and the horse, feeling himself disembarrassed, made
a desperate exertion, and succeeded in gaining the bank.
Our hero set off, at full speed, pursued by the troopers,
who had for a time stood motionless, in astonishment at
his temerity. Will, however, was well mounted; and,
having got the start, he kept it, menacing, with his pistols,
any pursuer, who seemed likely to gain on him&mdash;an
artifice which succeeded, although the arms were wet
and useless. He was chaced to the river Eske, which he
swam without hesitation; and, finding himself on Scottish
ground, and in the neighbourhood of friends, he
turned on the northern bank, and, in the true spirit of a
border rider, invited his followers to come through, and
drink with him. After this taunt, he proceeded on his
journey, and faithfully accomplished his mission. Such
were the exploits of the very last border freebooter of any
note.</p>

<p>The reader is not to regard the ballad as of genuine
and unmixed antiquity, though some stanzas are current
upon the border, in a corrupted state. They have been
eked and joined together, in the rude and ludicrous manner
of the original; but as it is to be considered as a modern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>ballad, it is transferred to this department of the
work.</p>

CHRISTIE'S WILL.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>He thought the warlocks o' the rosy cross.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>. v. 4.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"As for the rencounter betwixt Mr Williamson, schoolmaster
at Cowper (who has wrote a grammar), and the Rosicrucians,
I never trusted it, till I heard it from his own son,
who is present minister of Kirkaldy. He tells, that a stranger
came to Cowper, and called for him: after they had
drank a little, and the reckoning came to be paid, he whistled
for spirits; one, in the shape of a boy, came, and gave
him gold in abundance; no servant was seen riding with him
to the town, nor enter with him into the inn. He caused his
spirits, against next day, bring him noble Greek wine, from
the Pope's cellar, and tell the freshest news then at Rome;
then trysted Mr Williamson at London, who met the same
man, in a coach, near to London bridge, and who called on
him by his name; he marvelled to see any know him there;
at last he found it was his Rosicrucian. He pointed to a tavern,
and desired Mr Williamson to do him the favour to
dine with him at that house; whither he came at twelve
o'clock, and found him, and many others of good fashion
there, and a most splendid and magnificent table, furnished
with all the varieties of delicate meats, where they are all
served by spirits. At dinner, they debated upon the excellency
of being attended by spirits; and, after dinner, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
proposed to him to assume him into their society, and make
him participant of their happy life; but, among the other
conditions and qualifications requisite, this was one, that they
demanded his abstracting his spirit from all materiality, and
renouncing his baptismal engagements. Being amazed at this
proposal, he falls a praying; whereat they all disappear, and
leave him alone. Then he began to forethink what would
become of him, if he were left to pay that vast reckoning;
not having as much on him as would defray it. He calls the
boy, and asks, what was become of these gentlemen, and
what was to pay? He answered, there was nothing to pay,
for they had done it, and were gone about their affairs in the
city."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fountainhall</span>'s <i>Decisions</i>, Vol. I. p. 15. With great
deference to the learned reporter, this story has all the appearance
of a joke upon the poor schoolmaster, calculated at once
to operate upon his credulity, and upon his fears of being left
in pawn for the reckoning.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Or that the gypsies' glamour'd gang, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_158">158</a>. v. 4.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Besides the prophetic powers, ascribed to the gypsies in
most European countries, the Scottish peasants believe them
possessed of the power of throwing upon by-standers a spell,
to fascinate their eyes, and cause them to see the thing that is
not. Thus, in the old ballad of Johnie Faa, the elopement of
the countess of Cassillis, with a gypsey leader, is imputed to fascination:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As sune as they saw her weel-far'd face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cast the <i>glamour</i> ower her.<br /></span>

<p>Saxo Grammaticus mentions a particular sect of <i>Mathematicians</i>,
as he is pleased to call them, who "<i>per summam ludificandorum
oculorum peritiam, proprios alienosque vultus, variis
rerum imaginibus, adumbrare callebant; illicibusque formis
veros obscurare conspectus</i>." Merlin, the son of Ambrose,
was particularly skilled in this art, and displays it often in the
ol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>d metrical romance of <i>Arthour and Merlin</i>:</p>

<p>The <i>jongleurs</i> were also great professors of this mystery,
which has in some degree descended, with their name, on the

<p>Our modern professors of the <i>magic natural</i> would likewise
have been sorely put down by the <i>Jogulours</i> and <i>Enchantours</i>
of the <i>Grete Chan</i>; "for they maken to come in the air the
sone and the mone, beseminge to every mannes sight; and
aftre, they maken the nyght so dirke, that no man may se no
thing; and aftre, they maken the day to come agen, fair and

they bringin in daunces of the fairest damyselles of the

and than they maken knyghtes to justen in arms fulle lustyly;
and they rennen togidre a gret randoun, and they frusschen
togidere full fiercely, and they broken her speres so
rudely, that the trenchouns flen in sprotis and pieces alle

that it is marveyle for to se."&mdash;<i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John Mandeville</span>'s
<i>Travels</i>, p. 285. I question much, also, if the most
artful <i>illuminatus</i> of Germany could have matched the prodigies
exhibited by Pacolet and Adramain. "<i>Adonc Adramain
leva une cappe par dessus une pillier, et en telle sort, qu'il
sembla a ceux qui furent presens, que parmi la place couroit,
une riviere fort grande et terrible. Et en icelle riviere sembloit
avoir poissons en grand abondance, grands et petits. Et
quand ceux de pala&iacute;s virent l'eau si grande, ils commencer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>ent
tous a lever leur robes et a crier fort, comme sils eussent eu
peur d'estre noye; et Pacolet, qui l'enchantement regarda,
commenca a chanter, et fit un sort si subtil en son chant qui
sembla a tous ceux de lieu que parmy la riviere couroit un cerf
grand et cornu, qui jettoit et abbatoit a terre tout ce que devant
lui trouvoit, puis leur fut advis que voyoyent chasseurs
et veneurs courir apris le Cerf, avec grande puissance de levriers
et des chiens. Lors y eut plusieurs de la compagnie
qui saillirent au devant pour le Cerf attraper et cuyder prendre;
mais Pacolet fist tost le Cerf sailler. "Bien avez jou&eacute;,"
dit Orson, "et bien scavez vostre art user."</i>&mdash;L'Histoire des
Valentin et Orson, a Rouen, 1631. The receipt, to prevent the
operation of these deceptions, was, to use a sprig of four-leaved
clover. I remember to have heard (certainly very long ago,
for, at the time, I believed the legend), that a gypsey exercised
his <i>glamour</i> over a number of people at Haddington, to whom
he exhibited a common dung-hill cock, trailing, what appeared
to the spectators, a massy oaken trunk. An old man passed
with a cart of clover; he stopped, and picked out a four-leaved
blade; the eyes of the spectators were opened, and the oaken
trunk appeared to be a bulrush.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>I have tar-barrell'd mony a witch.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_159">159</a>. v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Human nature shrinks from the brutal scenes, produced by
the belief in witchcraft. Under the idea, that the devil imprinted
upon the body of his miserable vassals a mark, which
was insensible to pain, persons were employed to run needles
into the bodies of the old women who were suspected of witchcraft.
In the dawning of common sense upon this subject, a
complaint was made before the Privy Council of Scotland, 11th
September, 1678, by Catherine Liddell, a poor woman, against
the baron-bailie of Preston-Grange, and David Cowan (a professed
pricker), for having imprisoned, and most cruelly tortured
her. They answered, 1st, She was searched by her own
consent, <i>et volenti non fit injuria</i>; 2d, The pricker had learned
his trade from Kincaid, a famed pricker; 3d, He never acte<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>d,
but when called upon by magistrates or clergymen, so what he
did was <i>auctore pr&aelig;tore</i>; 4th, His trade was lawful; 5th, Perkins,
Delrio, and all divines and lawyers, who treat of witchcraft,
assert the existence of the marks, or <i>stigmata sagarum</i>;
and, 6thly, Were it otherwise, <i>Error communis facit jus</i>.&mdash;Answered,
1st, Denies consent; 2d, Nobody can validly consent
to their own torture; for, <i>Nemo est dominus membrorum suorum</i>;
3d, The pricker was a common cheat. The last arguments
prevailed; and it was found, that inferior judges "might
not use any torture, by pricking, or by with-holding them from
sleep;" the council reserving all that to themselves, the justices,
and those acting by commission from them. But Lord
Durie, a lord of session, could have no share in these inflictions.</p>

of poetical composition, and of vaticination, his memory,
even after the lapse of five hundred years, is regarded
with veneration by his countrymen. To give any thing
like a certain history of this remarkable man, would be
indeed difficult; but the curious may derive some satisfaction
from the particulars here brought together.</p>

<p>It is agreed, on all hands, that the residence, and probably
the birth-place, of this ancient bard, was Erceldoune,
a village situated upon the Leader, two miles above
its junction with the Tweed. The ruins of an ancient
tower are still pointed out as the Rhymer's castle. The
uniform tradition bears, that his sirname was Lermont, or
Learmont; and that the appellation of <i>The Rhymer</i> was
conferred on him in consequence of his poetical compositions.
There remains, nevertheless, some doubt upon this
subject. In a charter, which is subjoined at lengt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>h,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the
son of our poet designs himself "Thomas of Ercildoun,
son and heir of Thomas Rymour of Ercildoun," which
seems to imply, that the father did not bear the hereditary
name of Learmont; or, at least, was better known and
distinguished by the epithet, which he had acquired by
his personal accomplishments. I must, however, remark,
that, down to a very late period, the practice of distinguishing
the parties, even in formal writings, by the epithets
which had been bestowed on them from personal
circumstances, instead of the proper sirnames of their families,
was common, and indeed necessary, among the border
clans. So early as the end of the thirteenth century,
when sirnames were hardly introduced in Scotland, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>custom must have been universal. There is, therefore,
nothing inconsistent in supposing our poet's name to have
been actually Learmont, although, in this charter, he is
distinguished by the popular appellation of <i>The Rhymer</i>.</p>

<p>We are better able to ascertain the period at which
Thomas of Ercildoune lived, being the latter end of the
thirteenth century. I am inclined to place his death a
little farther back than Mr Pinkerton, who supposes that
he was alive in 1300 (<i>List of Scottish Poets</i>); which is
hardly, I think, consistent with the charter already quoted,
by which his son, in 1299, for himself and his heirs, conveys
to the convent of the Trinity of Soltre, the tenement
which he possessed by inheritance (<i>hereditarie</i>) in Ercildoun,
with all claim which he, or his predecessors, could
pretend thereto. From this we may infer, that the Rhymer
was now dead; since we find his son disposing of the family
property. Still, however, the argument of the learned
historian will remain unimpeached, as to the time of
the poet's birth. For if, as we learn from Barbour, his
prophecies were held in reputation<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> as early as 1306,
when Bruce slew the Red Cummin, the sanctity, and (let
me add to Mr Pinkerton's words) the uncertainty of antiquity,
must have already involved his character and writings.
In a charter of Peter de Haga de Bemersyde, which
unfortunately wants a date, the Rhymer, a near neighbour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>and, if we may trust tradition, a friend of the family,
appears as a witness.&mdash;<i>Cartulary of Melrose.</i></p>

<p>It cannot be doubted, that Thomas of Ercildoun was a
remarkable and important person in his own time, since,
very shortly after his death, we find him celebrated as a
prophet, and as a poet. Whether he himself made any
pretensions to the first of these characters, or whether it
was gratuitously conferred upon him by the credulity of
posterity, it seems difficult to decide. If we may believe
Mackenzie, Learmont only versified the prophecies delivered
by Eliza, an inspired nun, of a convent at Haddington.
But of this there seems not to be the most distant
proof. On the contrary, all ancient authors, who quote
the Rhymer's prophecies, uniformly suppose them to have
been emitted by himself. Thus, in Wintown's <i>Chronicle</i>,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of this fycht quilum spak Thomas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ersyldoune, that sayd in Derne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thare suld meit stalwartly, starke and sterne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sayd it in his prophecy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how he wist it was <i>ferly</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">
<i>Book</i> VIII. <i>chap.</i> 32.<br />
</p>

<p>There could have been no <i>ferly</i> (marvel) in Wintown's
eyes, at least, how Thomas came by his knowledge of future
events, had he ever heard of the inspired nun of Haddington;
which, it cannot be doubted, would have been a
solution of the mystery, much to the taste of the prior of
Lochleven.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Whatever doubts, however, the learned might have, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
to the source of the Rhymer's prophetic skill, the vulgar
had no hesitation to ascribe the whole to the intercourse
between the bard and the queen of Fa&euml;ry. The popular
tale bears, that Thomas was carried off, at an early age,
to the Fairy Land, where he acquired all the knowledge,
which made him afterwards so famous. After seven years
residence, he was permitted to return to the earth, to enlighten
and astonish his countrymen by his prophetic
powers; still, however, remaining bound to return to his
royal mistress, when she should intimate her pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Accordingly, while Thomas was making merry with his
friends, in the tower of Ercildoun, a person came running
in, and told, with marks of fear and astonishment, that a
hart and hind had left the neighbouring forest, and were,
composedly and slowly, parading the street of the village.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The prophet instantly arose, left his habitation,
and followed the wonderful animals to the forest, whence
he was never seen to return. According to the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>belief, he still "drees his weird" in Fairy Land, and is
one day expected to revisit earth. In the meanwhile, his
memory is held in the most profound respect. The Eildon
Tree, from beneath the shade of which he delivered
his prophecies, now no longer exists; but the spot is marked
by a large stone, called Eildon Tree Stone. A neighbouring
rivulet takes the name of the Bogle Burn (Goblin
Brook) from the Rhymer's supernatural visitants. The
veneration paid to his dwelling place, even attached itself
in some degree to a person, who, within the memory of
man, chose to set up his residence in the ruins of Learmont's
tower. The name of this man was Murray, a kind
of herbalist; who, by dint of some knowledge in simples,
the possession of a musical clock, an electrical machine,
and a stuffed aligator, added to a supposed communication
with Thomas the Rhymer, lived for many years in very
good credit as a wizard.</p>

<p>It seemed to the editor unpardonable to dismiss a person,
so important in border tradition as the Rhymer, without
some farther notice than a simple commentary upon
the following ballad. It is given from a copy, obtained
from a lady, residing not far from Ercildoun, corrected
and enlarged by one in Mrs Brown's MSS. The former
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>copy, however, as might be expected, is far more minute
as to local description. To this old tale the editor has
ventured to add a Second Part, consisting of a kind of
Cento, from the printed prophecies vulgarly ascribed to
the Rhymer; and a Third Part, entirely modern, founded
upon the tradition of his having returned with the hart
and hind, to the land of Fa&euml;rie. To make his peace with
the more severe antiquaries, the editor has prefixed to the
second part some remarks on Learmont's prophecies.</p>

<h5>NOTE AND APPENDIX<br />

<span class="small">TO<br /></span>

THOMAS THE RHYMER.<br />

<span class="small">PART FIRST.</span></h5>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>She pu'd an apple frae a tree</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>. v. 5.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The traditional commentary upon this ballad informs us, that
the apple was the produce of the fatal Tree of Knowledge, and
that the garden was the terrestrial paradise. The repugnance
of Thomas to be debarred the use of falsehood, when he might
find it convenient, has a comic effect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reader is here presented, from an old, and unfortunately
an imperfect MS., with the undoubted original of Thomas the
Rhymer's intrigue with the queen of Fa&euml;ry. It will afford great
amusement to those who would study the nature of traditional
poetry, and the changes effected by oral tradition, to compare
this ancient romance with the foregoing ballad. The same incidents
are narrated, even the expression is often the same; yet
the poems are as different in appearance, as if the older tale
had been regularly and systematically modernized by a poet of
the present day.</p>

PART SECOND.</h4>


<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">ALTERED FROM ANCIENT PROPHECIES.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The prophecies, ascribed to Thomas of Ercildoune, have
been the principal means of securing to him remembrance
"amongst the sons of his people." The author of <i>Sir
Tristrem</i> would long ago have joined, in the vale of oblivion,
Clerk of Tranent, who wrote the adventure of
"<i>Schir Gawain</i>," if, by good hap, the same current of
ideas respecting antiquity, which causes Virgil to be regarded
as a magician by the Lazaroni of Naples, had not
exalted the bard of Ercildoune to the prophetic character.
Perhaps, indeed, he himself affected it during his life.
We know at least, for certain, that a belief in his supernatural
knowledge was current soon after his death. His
prophecies are alluded to by Barbour, by Wintoun, and
by Henry the Minstrel, or <i>Blind Harry</i>, as he is usually
termed. None of these authors, however, give the words
of any of the Rhymer's vaticinations, but merely narrate,
historically, his having predicted the events of which they
speak. The earliest of the prophecies ascribed to him,
which is now extant, is quoted by Mr Pinkerton <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>from a
MS. It is supposed to be a response from Thomas of Ercildoune,
to a question from the heroic Countess of March,
renowned for the defence of the castle of Dunbar against
the English, and termed, in the familiar dialect of her
time, <i>Black Agnes</i> of Dunbar. This prophecy is remarkable,
in so far as it bears very little resemblance to any
verses published in the printed copy of the Rhymer's supposed
prophecies. The verses are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>La Countesse de Donbar demande a Thomas de Essedoune
quant la guerre d'Escoce prendreit fyn. E yl l'a repoundy
et dyt,</i></p></blockquote>

<i>Pinkerton's Poems, from Maitland's MSS. quoting
from Harl. Lib. 2253. F. 127.</i><br />
</p>

<p>As I have never seen the MS. from which Mr Pinkerton
makes this extract, and as the date of it is fixed by
him (certainly one of the most able antiquaries of our
age), to the reign of Edward I. or II., it is with great diffidence
that I hazard a contrary opinion. There can, however,
I believe, be little doubt, that these prophetic verses
are a forgery, and not the production of our Thomas the
Rhymer. But I am inclined to believe them of a later
date than the reign of Edward I. or II.</p>

<p>The gallant defence of the castle of Dunbar, by Black
Agnes, took place in the year 1337. The Rhymer died
previous to the year 1299 (see the charter, by his son, in
the introduction to the foregoing ballad). It seems, therefore,
very improbable, that the Countess of Dunbar could
ever have an opportunity of consulting Thomas the Rhymer,
since that would infer that she was married, or at
least engaged in state matters, previous to 1299; whereas
she is described as a young, or a middle-aged, woman, at
the period of her being besieged in the fortress, which
she so well defended. If the editor might indulge a conjecture,
he would suppose, that the prophecy was contrived
for the encouragement of the English invaders, during the
Scottish wars; and that the names of the Countess of Dunbar,
and of Thomas of Ercildoune, were used for the greater
credit of the forgery. According to this hypothesis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> it
seems likely to have been composed after the siege of
Dunbar, which had made the name of the Countess well
known, and consequently in the reign of Edward III. The
whole tendency of the prophecy is to aver, "that there
shall be no end of the Scottish war (concerning which
the question was proposed), till a final conquest of the
country by England, attended by all the usual severities
of war. When the cultivated country shall become forest&mdash;says
the prophecy;&mdash;when the wild animals shall
inhabit the abode of men;&mdash;when Scots shall not be
able to escape the English, should they crouch as hares
in their form&mdash;all these denunciations seem to refer to
the time of Edward III., upon whose victories the prediction
was probably founded." The mention of the
exchange betwixt a colt worth ten markes, and a quarter
of "whaty (indifferent) wheat," seems to allude to the
dreadful famine, about the year 1388. The independence
of Scotland was, however, as impregnable to the mines of
superstition, as to the steel of our more powerful and more
wealthy neighbours. The war of Scotland is, thank God,
at an end; but it is ended without her people having either
crouched, like hares, in their form, or being drowned
in their flight "for faute of ships,"&mdash;thank God for that
too. The prophecy, quoted in p. 179., is probably of the
same date, and intended for the same purpose. A minute
search of the records of the time would, probably, throw
additional light upon the allusions contained in these ancient
legends. Among various rhymes of prophetic import,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
which are at this day current amongst the people of
Teviotdale, is one, supposed to be pronounced by Thomas
the Rhymer, presaging the destruction of his habitation
and family:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The hare sall kittle (litter) on my hearth stane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there will never be a laird Learmont again.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first of these lines is obviously borrowed from that
in the MS, of the Harl. Library.&mdash;"When hares kendles
o' the her'stane"&mdash;an emphatic image of desolation. It
is also inaccurately quoted in the prophecy of Waldhave,
published by Andro Hart, 1613:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is a true talking that Thomas of tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hare shall hirple on the hard (hearth) stane."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Spottiswoode, an honest, but credulous historian, seems
to have been a firm believer in the authenticity of the prophetic
wares, vended in the name of Thomas of Ercildoun.
"The prophecies, yet extant in Scottish rhymes, whereupon
he was commonly called <i>Thomas the Rhymer</i>, may
justly be admired; having foretold, so many ages before,
the union of England and Scotland in the ninth degree
of the Bruce's blood, with the succession of Bruce
himself to the crown, being yet a child, and other divers
particulars, which the event hath ratified and made
good. Boethius, in his story, relateth his prediction of
King Alexander's death, and that he did foretell the same
to the Earl of March, the day before it fell out; saying,
'That before the next day at noon, such a tempest
should blow, as Scotland had not felt for many yea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>rs
before.' The next morning, the day being clear, and
no change appearing in the air, the nobleman did challenge
Thomas of his saying, calling him an impostor. He
replied, that noon was not yet passed. About which time,
a post came to advertise the earl, of the king his sudden
death. 'Then,' said Thomas, 'this is the tempest I foretold;
and so it shall prove to Scotland.' Whence, or
how, he had this knowledge, can hardly be affirmed;
but sure it is, that he did divine and answer truly of
many things to come."&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>, p. 47. Besides
that notable voucher, master Hector Boece, the good archbishop
might, had he been so minded, have referred to
Fordun for the prophecy of King Alexander's death. That
historian calls our bard "<i>ruralis ille vates</i>."&mdash;<i>Fordun</i>, lib. x.
cap. 40.</p>

<p>What Spottiswoode calls "the prophecies extant in
"Scottish rhyme," are the metrical predictions ascribed
to the prophet of Ercildoun, which, with many other compositions
of the same nature, bearing the names of Bede,
Merlin, Gildas, and other approved soothsayers, are contained
in one small volume, published by Andro Hart, at
Edinburgh, 1615. The late excellent Lord Hailes made
these compositions the subject of a dissertation, published
in his <i>Remarks on the History of Scotland</i>. His attention
is chiefly directed to the celebrated prophecy of our bard,
mentioned by Bishop Spottiswoode, bearing, that the
crowns of England and Scotland should be united in the
person of a king, son of a French queen, and rel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>ated to
Bruce in the ninth degree. Lord Hailes plainly proves,
that this prophecy is perverted from its original purpose,
in order to apply it to the succession of James VI. The
ground-work of the forgery is to be found in the prophecies
of Berlington, contained in the same collection, and
runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of Bruce's left side shall spring out as a leafe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As neere as the ninth degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shall be fleemed of faire Scotland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In France farre beyond the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then shall come againe ryding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes that many men may see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Aberladie he shall light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hempen helteres and horse of tre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0" style="letter-spacing:2em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However it happen for to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lyon shall be lord of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The French quen shal bearre the sonne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shal rule all Britainne to the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ane from the Bruce's blood shal come also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As neere as the ninth degree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0" style="letter-spacing:2em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shal there come a keene knight over the salt sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A keene man of courage and bold man of armes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A duke's son dowbled (<i>i.e.</i> dubbed), a borne mon in France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall our mirths augment, and mend all our harmes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the date of our Lord 1513, and thrice three thereafter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shall brooke all the broad isle to himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between 13 and thrice three the threip shal be ended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxons sall never recover after.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There cannot be any doubt, that this prophecy was inten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>ded
to excite the confidence of the Scottish nation in
the Duke of Albany, regent of Scotland, who arrived from
France in 1515, two years after the death of James IV.
in the fatal field of Flodden. The regent was descended
of Bruce by the left, <i>i.e.</i> by the female side, within the
ninth degree. His mother was daughter of the Earl of
Boulogne, his father banished from his country&mdash;"fleemit
of fair Scotland." His arrival must necessarily be by
sea, and his landing was expected at Aberlady, in the
Frith of Forth. He was a duke's son, dubbed knight;
and nine years, from 1513, are allowed him, by the pretended
prophet, for the accomplishment of the salvation
of his country, and the exaltation of Scotland over her
sister and rival. All this was a pious fraud, to excite the
confidence and spirit of the country.</p>

<p>The prophecy, put in the name of our Thomas the
Rhymer, as it stands in Hart's book, refers to a later period.
The narrator meets the Rhymer upon a land beside
a lee, who shows him many emblematical visions, described
in no mean strain of poetry. They chiefly relate
to the fields of Flodden and Pinkie, to the national distress
which followed these defeats, and to future halcyon days,
which are promised to Scotland. One quotation or two
will be sufficient to establish this fully:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our Scottish king sal come ful keene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red lyon beareth he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A feddered arrow sharp, I weene,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Shall make him winke and warre to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the field he shall be led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he is bludie and woe for blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet to his men shall he say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For God's luve, turn you againe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And give yon sutherne folk a frey!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why should I lose the right is mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My date is not to die this day."&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Who can doubt, for a moment, that this refers to the
battle of Flodden, and to the popular reports concerning
the doubtful fate of James IV.? Allusion is immediately
afterwards made to the death of George Douglas, heir
apparent of Angus, who fought and fell with his sovereign:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sternes three that day shall die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bears the harte in silver sheen.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The well-known arms of the Douglas family are the
heart and three stars. In another place, the battle of
Pinkie is expressly mentioned by name:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Pinken Cluch there shall be spilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much gentle blood that day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There shall the bear lose the guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eagill bear it away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To the end of all this allegorical and mystical rhapsody,
is interpolated, in the later edition by Andro Hart, a new
edition of Berlington's verses, before quoted, altered and
manufactured so as to bear reference to the accession of
James VI., which had just then taken place. The insertion
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> made with a peculiar degree of awkwardness, betwixt
a question, put by the narrator, concerning the name
and abode of the person who shewed him these strange
matters, and the answer of the prophet to that question:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then to the Bairne could I say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where dwells thou, or in what countrie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"[Or who shall rule the isle of Britane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From the north to the south sey?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A French queene shall beare the sonne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shall rule all Britaine to the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Which of the Bruce's blood shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As neere as the nint degree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I frained fast what was his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where that he came, from what country.]<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In Erslingtoun I dwell at hame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thomas Rymour men cals me."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is surely no one, who will not conclude, with
Lord Hailes, that the eight lines, inclosed in brackets, are
a clumsy interpolation, borrowed from Berlington, with
such alterations as might render the supposed prophecy
applicable to the union of the crowns.</p>

<p>While we are on this subject, it may be proper briefly
to notice the scope of some of the other predictions, in
Hart's Collection. As the prophecy of Berlington was
intended to raise the spirits of the nation, during the regency
of Albany, so those of Sybilla and Eltraine refer
to that of the Earl of Arran, afterwards Duke of Chatelherault,
during the minority of Mary, a period of similar
calamity. This is obvious from the following verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Take a thousand in calculation,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And the longest of the lyon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four crescents under one crowne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Saint Andrew's croce thrise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then threescore and thrise three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take tent to Merling truely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shall the warres ended be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never againe rise.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In that yere there shall a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A duke, and no crowned king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Becaus the prince shall be yong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tender of yeares.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The date, above hinted at, seems to be 1549, when the
Scottish regent, by means of some succours derived from
France, was endeavouring to repair the consequences of
the fatal battle of Pinkie. Allusion is made to the supply
given to the "Moldwarte" (England) by the fained
"hart" (the Earl of Angus). The regent is described by
his bearing the antelope; large supplies are promised
from France, and complete conquest predicted to Scotland
and her allies. Thus was the same hackneyed stratagem
repeated, whenever the interest of the rulers appeared to
stand in need of it. The regent was not, indeed, till after
this period, created Duke of Chatelherault; but that
honour was the object of his hopes and expectations.</p>

<p>The name of our renowned soothsayer is liberally used
as an authority, throughout all the prophecies published
by Andro Hart. Besides those expressly put in his name,
Gildas, another assumed personage, is supposed to derive
his knowledge from him; for he concludes thus:</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"True Thomas me told in a troublesome time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"In a harvest morn at Eldoun hills."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">
<i>The Prophecy of Gildas.</i><br />
</p>

<p>In the prophecy of Berlington, already quoted, we are
told,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Marvellous Merlin, that many men of tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And Thomas's sayings comes all at once."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>While I am upon the subject of these prophecies, may
I be permitted to call the attention of antiquaries to Merdwynn
Wyllt, or <i>Merlin the Wild</i>, in whose name, and by
no means in that of Ambrose Merlin, the friend of Arthur,
the Scottish prophecies are issued. That this personage
resided at Drummelziar, and roamed, like a second
Nebuchadnezzar, the woods of Tweeddale, in remorse for
the death of his nephew, we learn from Fordun. In the
<i>Scotichronicon</i>, lib. 3, cap. 31. is an account of an interview
betwixt St Kentigern and Merlin, then in this distracted
and miserable state. He is said to have been called
<i>Lailoken</i>, from his mode of life. On being commanded
by the saint to give an account of himself, he says,
that the penance, which he performs, was imposed on
him by a voice from heaven, during a bloody contest betwixt
Lidel and Carwanolow, of which battle he had been
the cause. According to his own prediction, he perished
at once by wood, earth, and water; for, being pursued
with stones by the rustics, he fell from a rock into the river
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>Tweed, and was transfixed by a sharp stake, fixed
there for the purpose of extending a fishing-net:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sude perfossus, lapide percussus et unda</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Haec tria Merlinum fertur inire necem.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sicque ruit, mersusque fuit lignoque perpendi,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et fecit vatem per terna pericula verum.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, in a metrical history of Merlin of Caledonia, compiled
by Geoffrey of Monmouth, from the traditions of the
Welch bards, this mode of death is attributed to a page,
whom Merlin's sister, desirous to convict the prophet of
falsehood, because he had betrayed her intrigues, introduced
to him, under three various disguises, enquiring
each time in what manner the person should die. To the
first demand Merlin answered, the party should perish by
a fall from a rock; to the second, that he should die by
a tree; and to the third, that he should be drowned. The
youth perished, while hunting, in the mode imputed by
Fordun to Merlin himself.</p>

<p>Fordun, contrary to the Welch authorities, confounds
this person with the Merlin of Arthur; but concludes by
informing us, that many believed him to be a different
person. The grave of Merlin is pointed out at Drummelziar,
in Tweeddale, beneath an aged thorn-tree. On the
east side of the church-yard, the brook, called Pausayl,
falls into the Tweed; and the following prophecy is said
to have been current concerning their union:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Tweed and Pausayl join at Merlin's grave,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Scotland and England shall one monarch have.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On the day of the coronation of James VI. the Tweed accordingly
overflowed, and joined the Pausayl at the prophet's
grave.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pennycuick</span>'s <i>History of Tweeddale</i>, p. 26.
These circumstances would seem to infer a communication
betwixt the south-west of Scotland and Wales, of a
nature peculiarly intimate; for I presume that Merlin
would retain sense enough to chuse, for the scene of his
wanderings, a country, having a language and manners
similar to his own.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the memory of Merlin Sylvester, or
the Wild, was fresh among the Scots during the reign of
James V. Waldhave,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> under whose name a set of prophecies
was published, describes himself as lying upon
Lomond Law; he hears a voice, which bids him stand to
his defence; he looks around, and beholds a flock of hares
and foxes<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> pursued over the mountain by a savage figure,
to whom he can hardly give the name of man. At the
sight of Waldhave, the apparition leaves the objects of
his pursuit, and assaults him with a club. Waldhave defends
himself with his sword, throws the savage to the
earth, and refuses to let him arise till he swear, by the
law and lead he lives upon, "to do him no harm." This
done, he permits him to arise, and marvels at his strange
appearance:</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He was formed like a freike (man) all his four quarters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And then his chin and his face haired so thick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With haire growing so grime, fearful to see."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He answers <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>briefly to Waldhave's enquiry, concerning his
name and nature, that he "drees his weird," <i>i.e.</i> does penance,
in that wood; and, having hinted that questions as
to his own state are offensive, he pours forth an obscure
rhapsody concerning futurity, and concludes,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Go musing upon Merlin if thou wilt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For I mean no more man at this time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is exactly similar to the meeting betwixt Merlin
and Kentigern in Fordun. These prophecies of Merlin
seem to have been in request in the minority of James V.;
for, among the amusements, with which Sir David Lindsay
diverted that prince during his infancy, are,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The prophecies of Rymer, Bede, and Merlin.</p></blockquote>

<p class="right">
<i>Sir David Lindsay's Epistle to the King.</i><br />
</p>

<p>And we find, in Waldhave, at least one allusion to the
very ancient prophecy, addressed to the countess of Dunbar:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is a true token that Thomas of tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a ladde with a ladye shall go over the fields.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></div>
<p>The original stands thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When laddes weddeth lovedies.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another prophecy of Merlin seems to have been current
about the time of the regent Morton's execution.&mdash;When
that nobleman was committed to the charge of
his accuser, captain James Stewart, newly created Earl of
Arran, to be conducted to his trial at Edinburgh, Spottiswoode
says, that he asked, "Who was earl of Arran?"
"and being answered that Captain James was the man,
after a short pause he said, 'And is it so? I know
then what I may look for!' meaning, as was thought,
that the old prophecy of the 'Falling of the heart<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
by the mouth of Arran,' should then be fulfilled. Whether
this was his mind or not, it is not known; but
some spared not, at the time when the Hamiltons were
banished, in which business he was held too earnest,
to say, that he stood in fear of that prediction, and
went that course only to disappoint it. But, if so it
was, he did find himself now deluded; for he fell by
the mouth of another Arran than he imagined."&mdash;<i>Spottiswoode</i>,
313. The fatal words, alluded to, seem to be
these in the prophecy of Merlin:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In the mouth of Arrane a selcouth shall fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Two bloodie hearts shall be taken with a false traine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And derfly dung down without any dome."<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>To return from these desultory remarks, into which
the editor has been led by the celebrated name of Merlin,
the style of all these prophecies, published by Hart,
is very much the same. The measure is alliterative,
and somewhat similar to that of <i>Pierce Plowman's Visions</i>;
a circumstance, which might entitle us to ascribe to some
of them an earlier date than the reign of James V., did
we not know that <i>Sir Galloran of Galloway</i>, and <i>Gawaine
and Gologras</i>, two romances rendered almost unintelligible
by the extremity of affected alliteration, are perhaps
not prior to that period. Indeed, although we may allow,
that, during much earlier times, prophecies, under
the names of those celebrated soothsayers, have been
current in Scotland, yet those published by Hart have
obviously been so often vamped and re-vamped, to serve
the political purposes of different periods, that it may be
shrewdly suspected, that, as in the case of Sir John Cutler's
transmigrated stockings, very little of the original
materials now remains. I cannot refrain from indulging
my readers with the publisher's title to the last prophecy;
as it contains certain curious information concerning
the queen of Sheba, who is identified with the Cum&aelig;an
Sybil: "Here followeth a prophecie, pronounced
by a noble queene and matron, called Sybilla, Regina
Austri, that came to Solomon. Through the which
she compiled four bookes, at the instance and request
of the said king Sol. and others divers: and the fourth
book was directed to a noble king, called Baldwine,
king of the broad isle of Britain; in the which sh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>e
maketh mention of two noble princes and emperours, the
which is called Leones. How these two shall subdue,
and overcome all earthlie princes to their diademe and
crowne, and also be glorified and crowned in the heaven
among saints. The first of these two is Constantinus
Magnus; that was Leprosus, the son of Saint Helene,
that found the croce. The second is the sixty king
of the name of Steward of Scotland, the which is our
most noble king." With such editors and commentators,
what wonder that the text became unintelligible,
even beyond the usual oracular obscurity of prediction?</p>

<p>If there still remain, therefore, among these predictions,
any verses having a claim to real antiquity, it seems now
impossible to discover them from those which are comparatively
modern. Nevertheless, as there are to be
found, in these compositions, some uncommonly wild and
masculine expressions, the editor has been induced to
throw a few passages together, into the sort of ballad to
which this disquisition is prefixed. It would, indeed, have
been no difficult matter for him, by a judicious selection,
to have excited, in favour of Thomas of Erceldoune, a
share of the admiration, bestowed by sundry wise persons
upon Mass Robert Fleming. For example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But then the lilye shal be loused when they least think;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clear king's blood shal quake for fear of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For churls shal chop off heads of their chief beirns,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And carfe of the crowns that Christ hath appointed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0" style="letter-spacing:2em;">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereafter, on every side, sorrow shal arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barges of clear barons down shal be sunken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seculars shal sit in spiritual seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Occupying offices anointed as they were."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Taking the lilye for the emblem of France, can there
be a more plain prophecy of the murder of her monarch,
the destruction of her nobility, and the desolation of her
hierarchy?</p>

<p>But, without looking farther into the signs of the times,
the editor, though the least of all the prophets, cannot
help thinking, that every true Briton will approve of his
application of the last prophecy quoted in the ballad.</p>

<p>Hart's collection of prophecies was frequently reprinted
during the last century, probably to favour the pretensions
of the unfortunate family of Stewart. For the
prophetic renown of Gildas and Bede, see <i>Fordun</i>, lib. 3.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Thomas's predictions, it
may be noticed, that sundry rhymes, passing for his prophetic
effusions, are still current among the vulgar. Thus,
he is said to have prophecied of the very ancient family
of Haig of Bemerside,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Betide, betide, whate'er betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haig shall be Haig of Bemerside.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The grandfather of the present proprietor of Bemerside
had twelve daughters, before his lady brought him a
male heir. The common people trembled for the credit
of their favourite soothsayer. The late Mr Haig was at
length born, and their belief in the prophecy confirmed
beyond a shadow of doubt.</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></div>
<p>Another memorable prophecy bore, that the Old Kirk
at Kelso, constructed out of the ruins of the abbey, should
fall when "at the fullest." At a very crowded sermon,
about thirty years ago, a piece of lime fell from the roof
of the church. The alarm, for the fulfilment of the
words of the seer, became universal; and happy were
they, who were nearest the door of the predestined edifice.
The church was in consequence deserted, and has
never since had an opportunity of tumbling upon a full
congregation. I hope, for the sake of a beautiful specimen
of Saxo-Gothick architecture, that the accomplishment
of this prophecy is far distant.</p>

<p>Another prediction, ascribed to the Rhymer, seems to
have been founded on that sort of insight into futurity,
possessed by most men of a sound and combining judgement.
It runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Eildon Tree if you shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brigg ower Tweed you there may see.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The spot in question commands an extensive prospect
of the course of the river; and it was easy to foresee, that,
when the country should become in the least degree improved,
a bridge would be somewhere thrown over the
stream. In fact, you now see no less than three bridges
from that elevated situation.</p>

<p>Corspatrick (Comes Patrick), Earl of March, but more
commonly taking his title from his castle of Dunbar, acted
a noted part during the wars of Edward I. in Scotland.
As Thomas of Erceldoune is said to have delivered to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>him
his famous prophecy of King Alexander's death, the editor
has chosen to introduce him into the following ballad.
All the prophetic verses are selected from Hart's publication.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> I do not know, whether the person here meant be Waldhave,

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> The strange occupation, in which Waldhave beholds Merlin engaged,
derives some illustration from a curious passage in Geoffrey
of Monmouth's life of Merlin, above quoted. The poem, after narrating,
that the prophet had fled to the forests in a state of distraction,
proceeds to mention, that, looking upon the stars one clear
evening, he discerned, from his astrological knowledge, that his wife,
Guendolen, had resolved, upon the next morning, to take another
husband. As he had presaged to her that this would happen, and
had promised her a nuptial gift (cautioning her, however, to keep
the bridegroom out of his sight), he now resolved to make good his
word. Accordingly, he collected all the stags and lesser game in
his neighbourhood; and, having seated himself upon a buck, drove
the herd before him to the capital of Cumberland, where Guendolen
resided. But her lover's curiosity leading him to inspect too nearly
this extraordinary cavalcade, Merlin's rage was awakened, and
he slew him with the stroke of an antler of the stag. The original
runs thus:

<h4><a name="THOMAS_THE_RHYMER3" id="THOMAS_THE_RHYMER3">THOMAS THE RHYMER.</a><br />

PART THIRD&mdash;MODERN.</h4>

<p class="center">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thomas the Rhymer was renowned among his contemporaries,
as the author of the celebrated romance of <i>Sir
Tristrem</i>. Of this once admired poem only one copy is now
known to exist, which is in the Advocates' Library. The
editor, in 1804, published a small edition of this curious
work; which, if it does not revive the reputation of the bard
of Ercildoune, will be at least the earliest specimen of Scottish
poetry, hitherto published. Some account of this romance
has already been given to the world in <span class="smcap">Mr Ellis</span>'s
<i>Specimens of Ancient Poetry</i>, Vol. I. p. 165, 3d. p. 410; a
work, to which our predecessors and our posterity are alike
obliged; the former, for the preservation of the best selected
examples of their poetical taste; and the latter, for
a history of the English language, which will only cease
to be interesting with the existence of our mother-tongue,
and all that genius and learning have recorded in it. It
is sufficient here to mention, that, so great was the reputation
of the romance of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, that few were thought
capable of reciting it after the manner of the author&mdash;a
circumstance alluded to by Robert de Brunne, the annalist:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I see in song, in sedgeyng tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Erceldoun, and of Kendale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now thame says as they thame wroght,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thare saying it semes nocht.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou may here in Sir Tristrem,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>It appears, from a very curious MS. of the thirteenth
century, <i>penes</i> Mr Douce, of London, containing a French
metrical romance of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, that the work of our
Thomas the Rhymer was known, and referred to, by the
minstrels of Normandy and Bretagne. Having arrived
at a part of the romance, where reciters were wont to differ
in the mode of telling the story, the French bard expressly
cites the authority of the poet of Erceldoune:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Plusurs de nos granter ne volent,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Co que del naim dire se solent,</i><br /></span>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Thomas</span> <i>ico granter ne volt,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et si volt par raisun mostrer,</i><br /></span>

</div></div>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></div>
<p>The tale of <i>Sir Tristrem</i>, as narrated in the Edinburgh
MS., is totally different from the voluminous romance
in prose, originally compiled on the same subject
by Rusticien de Puise, and analysed by M. de Tressan;
but agrees in every essential particular with the metrical
performance, just quoted, which is a work of much higher
antiquity.</p>

<p>The following attempt to commemorate the Rhymer's
poetical fame, and the traditional account of his marvellous
return to Fairy Land, being entirely modern, would
have been placed with greater propriety among the class
of Modern Ballads, had it not been for its immediate connection
with the first and second parts of the same story.</p>

<p class="center">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>Smaylho'me, or Smallholm Tower, the scene of the following
ballad, is situated on the northern boundary of
Roxburghshire, among a cluster of wild rocks, called Sandiknow-Crags,
the property of Hugh Scott, Esq. of Harden.
The tower is a high square building, surrounded by
an outer wall, now ruinous. The circuit of the outer
court, being defended, on three sides, by a precipice and
morass, is accessible only from the west, by a steep and
rocky path. The apartments, as is usual in a border-keep,
or fortress, are placed one above another, and communicate
by a narrow stair; on the roof are two bartizans,
or platforms, for defence or pleasure. The inner door of
the tower is wood, the outer an iron gate; the distance
between them being nine feet, the thickness, namely, of
the wall. From the elevated situation of Smaylho'me
Tower, it is seen many miles in every direction. Among
the crags, by which it is surrounded, one, more eminent,
is called the <i>Watchfold</i>, and is said to have been the station
of a beacon, in the times of war with England.
Without the tower-court is a ruined chapel. Brotherstone
is a heath, in the neighbourhood of Smaylho'me Tower.</p>

<p>This ballad was first printed in Mr <span class="smcap">Lewis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></span>'s <i>Tales of
Wonder</i>. It is here published, with some additional illustrations,
particularly an account of the battle of Ancram
Moor; which seemed proper in a work upon border antiquities.
The catastrophe of the tale is founded upon a
well-known Irish tradition.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This ancient fortress and its
vicinity formed the scene of the editor's infancy, and
seemed to claim from him this attempt to celebrate them
in a Border Tale.</p>

THE EVE OF ST JOHN.</h4>


<hr class="tb" />

<h5><i>BATTLE OF ANCRUM MOOR.</i></h5>

<p>Lord Evers, and Sir Brian Latoun, during the year 1544,
committed the most dreadful ravages upon the Scottish frontiers,
compelling most of the inhabitants, and especially the
men of Liddesdale, to take assurance under the king of England.
Upon the 17th November, in that year, the sum total
of their depredations stood thus, in the bloody ledger of Lord
Evers:</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Murdin</span>'s <i>State Papers</i>, Vol. I. p. 51.</p>


<p>The king of England had promised to these two barons a
feudal grant of the country, which they had thus reduced to a
desert; upon hearing which, Archibald Douglas, the seventh
Earl of Angus, is said to have sworn to write the deed of investiture
upon their skins, with sharp pens and bloody ink, in
resentment for their having defaced the tombs of his ancestors,
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> Melrose.&mdash;<i>Godscroft.</i> In 1545, Lord Evers and Latoun
again entered Scotland, with an army consisting of 3000 mercenaries,
1500 English borderers, and 700 assured Scottish-men,
chiefly Armstrongs, Turnbulls, and other broken clans.
In this second incursion, the English generals even exceeded
their former cruelty. Evers burned the tower of Broomhouse,
with its lady (a noble and aged woman, says Lesley), and her
whole family. The English penetrated as far as Melrose, which
they had destroyed last year, and which they now again pillaged.
As they returned towards Jedburgh, they were followed
by Angus, at the head of 1000 horse, who was shortly after
joined by the famous Norman Lesley, with a body of Fife-men.
The English, being probably unwilling to cross the Teviot,
while the Scots hung upon their rear, halted upon Ancram
Moor, above the village of that name; and the Scottish general
was deliberating whether to advance or retire, when Sir
Walter Scott,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of Buccleuch, came up at full speed, with a
small, but chosen body of his retainers, the rest of whom were
near at hand. By the advice of this experienced warrior (to
whose conduct Pitscottie and Buchanan ascribe the success of
the engagement), Angus withdrew from the height which he
occupied, and drew up his forces behind it, upon a piece of
low flat ground, called Panier-heugh, or Peniel-heugh. The
spare horses being sent to an eminence in their rear, appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>to the English to be the main body of the Scots, in the act of
flight. Under this persuasion, Evers and Latoun hurried precipitately
forwards, and, having ascended the hill, which their
foes had abandoned, were no less dismayed than astonished, to
find the phalanx of Scottish Spearmen drawn up, in firm array,
upon the flat ground below. The Scots in their turn became the
assailants. A heron, roused from the marshes by the tumult,
soared away betwixt the encountering armies: "O!" exclaimed
Angus, "that I had here my white goss-hawk, that we
might all yoke at once!"&mdash;<i>Godscroft.</i> The English, breathless
and fatigued, having the setting sun and wind full in their
faces, were unable to withstand the resolute and desperate
charge of the Scottish lances. No sooner had they begun to
waver, than their own allies, the assured borderers, who had
been waiting the event, threw aside their red crosses, and,
joining their countrymen, made a most merciless slaughter
among the English fugitives, the pursuers calling upon each
other to "remember Broomhouse!"&mdash;<i>Lesley</i>, p. 478. In the
battle fell Lord Evers, and his son, together with Sir Brian Latoun,
and 800 Englishmen, many of whom were persons of
rank. A thousand prisoners were taken. Among these was a
patriotic alderman of London, Read by name, who, having
contumaciously refused to pay his portion of a benevolence,
demanded from the city by Henry VIII., was sent by royal authority
to serve against the Scots. These, at settling his ransom,
he found still more exorbitant in their exactions than the
monarch.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Redpath</span>'s <i>Border History</i>, p. 553. Evers was
much regretted by King Henry, who swore to avenge his death
upon Angus, against whom he conceived himself to have particular
grounds of resentment, on account of favours received by
the Earl at his hands. The answer of Angus was worthy of a
Douglas: "Is our brother-in-law offended,"<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> said he, "that
I, as a good Scotsman, have avenged my ravaged country,
and the defaced tombs of my ancestors, upon Ralph Evers?

<p>Such was the noted battle of Ancram Moor. The spot, on
which it was fought, is called Lyliard's Edge, from an Amazonian
Scottish woman of that name, who is reported, by tradition,
to have distinguished herself in the same manner as squire
Witherington. The old people point out her monument, now
broken and defaced. The inscription is said to have been legible
within this century, and to have run thus:</p>

<p>It appears, from a passage in Stowe, that an ancestor of
Lord Evers held also a grant of Scottish lands from an English
monarch. "I have seen," says the historian, "under the
broad-seale of the said King Edward I., a manor, called Ketnes,
in the countie of Ferfare, in Scotland, and neere the
furthest part of the same nation northward, given to John
Eure and his heiress, ancestor to the Lord Eure, that now
is, for his service done in these partes, with market, &amp;c.
dated at Lanercost, the 20th day of October, anno regis,
34."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Stowe</span>'s <i>Annals</i>, p. 210. This grant, like that of
Henry, must have been dangerous to the receiver.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>There is a nun in Dryburgh bower.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_239">239</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The circumstance of the nun, "who never saw the day," is
not entirely imaginary. About fifty years ago, an unfortunate
female-wanderer took up her residence in a dark vault, among
the ruins of Dryburgh abbey, which, during the day, she
never quitted. When night fell, she issued from this miserable
habitation, and went to the house of Mr Halliburton of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Newmains, the editor's great-grandfather, or to that of Mr
Erskine of Sheilfield, two gentlemen of the neighbourhood.
From their charity, she obtained such necessaries as she could
be prevailed upon to accept. At twelve, each night, she lighted
her candle, and returned to her vault; assuring her friendly
neighbours, that, during her absence, her habitation was arranged
by a spirit, to whom she gave the uncouth name of
<i>Fatlips</i>; describing him as a little man, wearing heavy iron
shoes, with which he trampled the clay floor of the vault, to
dispel the damps. This circumstance caused her to be regarded,
by the well-informed, with compassion, as deranged in her
understanding; and by the vulgar, with some degree of terror.
The cause of her adopting this extraordinary mode of life she
would never explain. It was, however, believed to have been
occasioned by a vow, that, during the absence of a man, to
whom she was attached, she would never look upon the sun.
Her lover never returned. He fell during the civil-war of
1745-6, and she never more would behold the light of day.</p>

<p>The vault, or rather dungeon, in which this unfortunate
woman lived and died, passes still by the name of the supernatural
being, with which its gloom was tenanted by her disturbed
imagination, and few of the neighbouring peasants dare enter
it by night.</p>

<h3><a name="LORD_SOULIS" id="LORD_SOULIS">LORD SOULIS.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY J. LEYDEN.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The subject of the following ballad is a popular tale of
the Scottish borders. It refers to transactions of a period
so important, as to have left an indelible impression on the
popular mind, and almost to have effaced the traditions of
earlier times. The fame of Arthur, and the Knights of
the Round Table, always more illustrious among the
Scottish borderers, from their Welch origin, than Fin Maccoul,
and Gow Macmorne, who seem not, however, to
have been totally unknown, yielded gradually to the renown
of Wallace, Bruce, Douglas, and the other patriots,
who so nobly asserted the liberty of their country.&mdash;Beyond
that period, numerous, but obscure and varying legends,
refer to the marvellous Merlin, or Myrrdin <i>the
Wild</i>, and Michael Scot, both magicians of notorious fame.
In this instance the enchanters have triumphed over the
<i>true man</i>. But the charge of magic was transferred from
the ancient sorcerers to the objects of popular resentment
of every age; and the partizans of the Baliols, the abettors
of the English faction, and the enemies of the protestant,
and of the presbyterian reformation, have been
indiscriminately stigmatized as necromancers and <i>warlocks</i>.
Thus, Lord Soulis, Archbishop Sharp, Grierson of Lagg,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and Graham of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, receive
from tradition the same supernatural attributes. According
to Dalrymple,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> the family of Soulis seem to have
been powerful during the contest between Bruce and Baliol;
for adhering to the latter of whom they incurred
forfeiture. Their power extended over the south and west
marches; and near Deadrigs,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> in the parish of Eccles, in
the east marches, their family-bearings still appear on an
obelisk. William de Soulis, Justiciarius Laodoni&aelig;, in
1281, subscribed the famous obligation, by which the nobility
of Scotland bound themselves to acknowledge the
sovereignty of the Maid of Norway, and her descendants.
<span class="smcap">Rhymer</span>, Tom. II. pp. 266, 279; and, in 1291, Nicholas
de Soulis appears as a competitor for the crown of Scotland,
which he claimed as the heir of Margery, a bastard
daughter of Alexander II., and wife of Allan Durward, or
Chuissier.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Carte</span>, p. 177. <span class="smcap">Dalrymple's</span> <i>Annals</i>, Vol. I.
p. 203.</p>

<p>But their power was not confined to the marches; for
the barony of Saltoun, in the shire of Haddington, derived
its name from the family; being designed Soulistoun, in a
charter to the predecessors of Nevoy of that ilk, seen by
Dalrymple; and the same frequently appears among
those of the benefactors and witnesses in the chartularies
of abbeys, particularly in that of Newbottle. Ranulphus
de Soulis occurs as a witness, in a charter, granted by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>King David, of the teindis of Stirling; and he, or one of
his successors, had afterwards the appellation of <i>Pincerna
Regis</i>. The following notices of the family and its decline,
are extracted from Robertson's <i>Index of Lost Charters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
Various repetitions occur, as the index is copied
from different rolls, which appear to have never been accurately
arranged.</p>

</div>

<p>The hero of tradition seems to be William, Lord Soullis,
whose name occurs so frequently in the foregoing list
of forfeitures; by which he appears to have possessed the
whole district of Liddesdale, with Westerkirk and Kirkandrews,
in Dumfries-shire, the lands of Gilmertoun, near
Edinburgh, and the rich baronies of Nisbet, Longnewton,
Caverton, Maxtoun, and Mertoun, in Roxburghshire. He
was of royal descent, being the grandson of Nicholas de
Soulis, who claimed the crown of Scotland, in right of his
grandmother, daughter to Alexander II.; and who, could
her legitimacy have been ascertained, must have excluded
the other competitors. The elder brother of William,
was John de Soulis, a gallant warrior, warmly attached
to the interests of his country, who, with fifty borderers,
defeated and made prisoner Sir Andrew Harclay, at the
head of three hundred Englishmen; and was himself slain,
fighting in the cause of Edward the Bruce, at the battle of
Dundalk, in Ireland, 1318. He had been joint-warden
of the kingdom with John Cummin, after the abdication
of the immortal Wallace, in 1300; in which character he
was recognised by John Baliol, who, in a charter granted
after his dethronement, and dated at Rutherglen, in the
ninth year of his reign (1302), styles him "<i>Custos regni
"nostri</i>." The treason of William, his successor, occasioned
the downfall of the family. This powerful baron
entered into a conspiracy against Robert the Bruce, in
which many persons of rank were engaged. The object,
according to Barbour, was to elevate Lord Soulis to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Scottish throne. The plot was discovered by the Countess
of Strathern. Lord Soulis was seized at Berwick, although
he was attended, says Barbour, by three hundred
and sixty squires, besides many gallant knights. Having
confessed his guilt, in full parliament, his life was spared
by the king; but his domains were forfeited, and he himself
confined in the castle of Dumbarton, where he died.
Many of his accomplices were executed; among others,
the gallant David de Brechin, nephew to the king, whose
sole crime was having concealed the treason, in which
he disdained to participate.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The parliament, in which
so much noble blood was shed, was long remembered by
the name of the <i>Black Parliament</i>. It was held in the
year 1320.</p>

<p>From this period the family of Soulis makes no figure
in our annals. Local tradition, however, more faithful
to the popular sentiment than history, has recorded the
character of their chief, and attributed to him many actions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>which seem to correspond with that character. His
portrait is by no means flattering; uniting every quality
which could render strength formidable, and cruelty detestable.
Combining prodigious bodily strength with
cruelty, avarice, dissimulation, and treachery, is it surprising
that a people, who attributed every event of life,
in a great measure, to the interference of good or evil
spirits, should have added to such a character the mystical
horrors of sorcery? Thus, he is represented as a
cruel tyrant and sorcerer; constantly employed in oppressing
his vassals, harassing his neighbours, and fortifying
his castle of Hermitage against the king of Scotland;
for which purpose he employed all means, human
and infernal: invoking the fiends, by his incantations,
and forcing his vassals to drag materials, like beasts of
burden. Tradition proceeds to relate, that the Scottish
king, irritated by reiterated complaints, peevishly exclaimed
to the petitioners, "Boil him, if you please,
but let me hear no more of him." Satisfied with this
answer, they proceeded with the utmost haste to execute
the commission; which they accomplished, by boiling
him alive on the Nine-stane Rig, in a cauldron, said to
have been long preserved at Skelf-hill, a hamlet betwixt
Hawick and the Hermitage. Messengers, it is said, were
immediately dispatched by the king, to prevent the eff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>ects
of such a hasty declaration; but they only arrived
in time to witness the conclusion of the ceremony. The
castle of Hermitage, unable to support the load of iniquity,
which had been long accumulating within its walls,
is supposed to have partly sunk beneath the ground; and
its ruins are still regarded by the peasants with peculiar
aversion and terror. The door of the chamber, where
Lord Soulis is said to have held his conferences with the
evil spirits, is supposed to be opened once in seven years,
by that d&aelig;mon, to which, when he left the castle, never
to return, he committed the keys, by throwing them over
his left shoulder, and desiring it to keep them till his return.
Into this chamber, which is really the dungeon of
the castle, the peasant is afraid to look; for such is the
active malignity of its inmate, that a willow, inserted at
the chinks of the door, is found peeled, or stripped of its
bark, when drawn back. The Nine-stane Rig, where Lord
Soulis was boiled, is a declivity, about one mile in breadth,
and four in length, descending upon the water of Hermitage,
from the range of hills which separate Liddesdale
and Teviotdale. It derives its name from one of those
circles of large stones, which are termed Druidical, nine
of which remained to a late period. Five of these stones
are still visible; and two are particularly pointed out, as
those which supported the iron bar, upon which the fatal
cauldron was suspended.</p>

<p>The formation of ropes of sand, according to popu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>lar
tradition, was a work of such difficulty, that it was assigned
by Michael Scot to a number of spirits, for which
it was necessary for him to find some interminable employment.
Upon discovering the futility of their attempts
to accomplish the work assigned, they petitioned their
task-master to be allowed to mingle a few handfuls of barley-chaff
with the sand. On his refusal, they were forced
to leave untwisted the ropes which they had shaped. Such
is the traditionary hypothesis of the vermicular ridges of
the sand on the shore of the sea.</p>

<p><i>Redcap</i> is a popular appellation of that class of spirits
which haunt old castles. Every ruined tower in the south
of Scotland is supposed to have an inhabitant of this species.</p>

<h4>NOTES<br />

<span class="small">ON</span><br />

LORD SOULIS.</h4>

<p class="center">BY THE EDITOR.</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></div>
<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tradition regarding the death of Lord Soulis, however
singular, is not without a parallel in the real history of Scotland.
The same extraordinary mode of cookery was actually
practised (<i>horresco referens</i>) upon the body of a sheriff of the
Mearns. This person, whose name was Melville of Glenbervie,
bore his faculties so harshly, that he became detested by
the barons of the country. Reiterated complaints of his conduct
having been made to James I. (or, as others say, to the
Duke of Albany), the monarch answered, in a moment of unguarded
impatience, "Sorrow gin the sheriff were sodden, and
supped in broo'!" The complainers retired, perfectly satisfied.
Shortly after, the lairds of Arbuthnot, Mather, Laurestoun,
and Pittaraw, decoyed Melville to the top of the hill of
Garvock, above Lawrencekirk, under pretence of a grand hunting
party. Upon this place (still called the <i>Sheriff's Pot</i>), the
barons had prepared a fire and a boiling cauldron, into which
they plunged the unlucky sheriff. After he was <i>sodden</i> (as the
king termed it), for a sufficient time, the savages, that they
might literally observe the royal mandate, concluded the scene
of abomination, by actually partaking of the hell-broth.</p>

<p>The three lairds were outlawed for this offence; and Barclay,
one of their number, to screen himself from justice, erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the kaim (<i>i.e.</i> the camp, or fortress) of Mathers, which
stands upon a rocky, and almost inaccessible peninsula, overhanging
the German ocean. The laird of Arbuthnot is said to
have eluded the royal vengeance, by claiming the benefit of the
law of clan Macduff, concerning which the curious reader will
find some particulars subjoined. A pardon, or perhaps a deed
of replegiation, founded upon that law, is said to be still extant
among the records of the viscount of Arbuthnot.</p>

<p>Pellow narrates a similar instance of atrocity, perpetrated
after the death of Muley Ismael, emperor of Morocco, in
1727, when the inhabitants of Old Fez, throwing off all allegiance
to his successor, slew "Alchyde Boel le Rosea, their
old governor, boiling his flesh, and many, through spite, eating
thereof, and throwing what they could not eat of it to the
dogs."&mdash;See <span class="smcap">Pellow's</span> <i>Travels in South Barbary</i>. And we
may add, to such tales, the oriental tyranny of Zenghis Khan,
who immersed seventy Tartar Khans in as many boiling cauldrons.</p>

<p>The punishment of boiling seems to have been in use among
the English at a very late period, as appears from the following
passage in <span class="smcap">Stowe's</span> <i>Chronicle</i>:&mdash;"The 17th of March (1524),
Margaret Davy, a maid, was boiled at Smithfield, for poisoning
of three households that she had dwelled in." But unquestionably
the usual practice of Smithfield cookery, about
that period, was by a different application of fire.</p>


<h5>LAW OF CLAN MACDUFF.</h5>

<p>Though it is rather foreign to the proper subject of this work,
many readers may not be displeased to have some account of
the curious privilege enjoyed by the descendants of the famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>Macduff, thane of Fife, and thence called the Law of the Clan,
or family, bearing his name.</p>

<p>When the revolution was accomplished, in which Macbeth
was dethroned and slain, Malcolm, sensible of the high services
of the thane of Fife, is said, by our historians, to have promised
to grant the first three requests he should make. Macduff
accordingly demanded, and obtained, first, that he and his
successors, lords of Fife, should place the crown on the king's
head at his coronation; secondly, that they should lead the
vanguard of the army, whenever the royal banner was displayed;
and, lastly, this privilege of clan Macduff, whereby any
person, being related to Macduff within the ninth degree, and
having committed homicide in <i>chaude melle</i> (without premeditation),
should, upon flying to Macduff's Cross, and paying a
certain fine, obtain remission of their guilt. Such, at least, is
the account given of the law by all our historians. Nevertheless,
there seems ground to suspect, that the privilege did not
amount to an actual and total remission of the crime, but only
to a right of being exempted from all other courts of jurisdiction,
except that of the lord of Fife. The reader is presented
with an old document, in which the law of clan Macduff is
pleaded on behalf of one of the ancestors of Moray of Abercairny;
and it is remarkable that he does not claim any immunity,
but solely a right of being re-pledged, because his cause
had already been tried by Robert earl of Fife, the sole competent
judge. But the privilege of being answerable only to the
chief of their own clan, was, to the descendants of Macduff, almost
equivalent to an absolute indemnity.</p>

<p>Macduff's Cross was situated near Lindores, on the march
dividing Fife from Strathern. The form of this venerable monument
unfortunately offended the zeal of the reformer, Knox,
and it was totally demolished by his followers. The pedestal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
a solid block of stone, alone escaped the besom of destruction.
It bore an inscription, which, according to the apocryphal account
of Sir Robert Sibbald, was a mixture of Latin, Saxon,
Danish, and old French. Skene has preserved two lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Propter Makgridim et hoc oblatum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accipe Smeleridem super lampade limpid&aelig; labrum<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="right">
<i>Skene, de verb. sig. voce Clan Macduff.</i><br />
</p>

<p>The full inscription, real or pretended, may be found in Sir
Robert Sibbald's <i>History of Fife</i>, and in James Cunninghame's
<i>Essay upon Macduff's Cross</i>, together with what is called a
translation, or rather paraphrase, of the piebald jargon which
composes it. In Gough's edition of Camden's Britannia, a different
and more intelligible version is given, on the authority
of a Mr Douglas of Newburgh. The cross was dedicated to a
St Macgider. Around the pedestal are tumuli, said to be the
graves of those, who, having claimed the privilege of the law,
failed in proving their consanguinity to the thane of Fife. Such
persons were instantly executed. The people of Newburgh believe,
that the spectres of these criminals still haunt the ruined
cross, and claim that mercy for their souls, which they had
failed to obtain for their mortal existence.</p>

<p>The late Lord Hailes gives it as his opinion, that the indulgence
was only to last till the tenth generation from Macduff.</p>

<p>Fordun and Wintoun state, that the fine, to be paid by the
person taking sanctuary, was twenty-four merks for a gentleman,
and twelve merks for a yeoman. Skene affirms it to be
nine cows, and a colpindach (<i>i.e.</i> a quey, or cow of one or two
years old).&mdash;<i>Fordun</i>, lib. 5, cap. 9.; <i>Wintoun's Cronykel</i>, b. 6,
ch. 19.; <i>Skene, ut supra.</i> The last cited author avers, that he
has seen an old evident, bearing, that Spens of Wormestoun,
being of Macduff's kin, enjoyed this privilege for the slaughter
of one Kinnermonth. The following deed, of a like nature, is
published from a copy, accurately transcribed from an original
deed, in the hands of the late Mr Cuming, of the Herald-Office,
Edinburgh, by Messrs Brown and Gibb, librarians to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Faculty of Advocates. The blanks are occasioned by some
parts of the deed having been obliterated.</p>

<p>The idea of Lord Soulis' familiar seems to be derived from
the curious story of the spirit Orthone and the lord of Corasse,
which, I think, the reader will be pleased to see, in all its Gothic
simplicity, as translated from Froissart, by the lord of Berners.</p>

<p>"It is great marveyle to consyder one thynge, the whiche
was shewed to me in the earl of Foix house at Ortayse, of
hym that enfourmed me of the busynesse at Juberothe (Aljubarota,
where the Spaniards, with their French allies, were
defeated by the Portugueze, A.D. 1385). He showed me one
thyng that I have oftentymes thought on sithe, and shall do
as longe as I live. As thys squyer told me that of trouthe
the next day after the battayl was thus fought, at Juberoth,
the erle of Foiz knewe it, whereof I had gret marveyle; for
the said Sonday, Monday, and Tuesday, the erle was very pensyf,
and so sadde of chere, that no man could have a worde
of hym. And all the same three days he wold nat issue out
of his chambre, nor speke to any man, though they were never
so nere about hym. And, on the Tuesday night, he called
to him his brother Arnault Guyllyam, and sayd to hym,
with a soft voice, 'Our men hath had to do, whereof I am
sorrie; for it is come of them, by their voyage, as I sayd or
they departed.' Arnault Guyllyam, who was a sage knight,
and knewe right well his brother's condicions (<i>i.e.</i> temper),
stode still and gave none answere. And than the erle, wh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>o
thought to declare his mind more plainlye, for long he had
borne the trouble thereof in his herte, spake agayn more
higher than he dyd before, and sayd, 'By God, Sir Arnault,
it is as I saye, and shortely ye shall here tidynges thereof; but
the countrey of Byerne, this hundred yere, never lost such a
losse, at no journey, as they have done now in Portugal.'&mdash;Dyvers
knyghtes and squyers, that were there present, and
herde hym say so, stode styll, and durst nat speke, but they
remembered his wordes. And within a ten days after, they
knewe the trouthe thereof, by such as had been at the busynesse,
and there they shewed every thinge as it was fortuned
at Juberoth. Than the erle renewed agayn his dolour, and
all the countreye were in sorrowe, for they had lost their
parentes, brethren, chyldren, and frendes. 'Saint Mary!'
quod I to the squyer that shewed me thys tale, 'how is it,
that the earl of Foiz could know, on one daye, what was done,
within a day or two before, beyng so farre off?'&mdash;'By my
faythe, Sir,' quod he, 'as it appeared well, he knewe it.'&mdash;Than
he is a diviner,' quod I, 'or els he hath messangers,
that flyethe with the wynde, or he must needs have some
craft.' The squyer began to laugh, and sayd, "Surely he
must know it, by some art of negromansye or otherwyse. To
saye the trouthe, we cannot tell how it is, but by our ymaginacions.'&mdash;'Sir,'
quod I, 'suche ymaginacions as ye have
therein, if it please you to shew me, I wold be gladde therof;
and if it be suche a thynge as ought to be secrete, I shall
nat publysshe it, nor as long as I am in thys countrey I shall
never speke worde thereof.'&mdash;'I praye you therof,' quod the
squyer, 'for I wolde nat it shulde be knowen, that I shulde
speke thereof. But I shall shewe you, as dyvers men speketh
secretelye, whan they be togyder as frendes.' Than he
drew me aparte into a corner of the chapell at Ortayse, and
then began his tale, and sayd:</p>

<p>"It is well a twenty yeares paste, that there was, in this countre,
a barone, called Raymond, lorde of Corasse, whyche is a
sevyn leagues from this towne of Ortayse. Thys lord of Cora<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>sse
had that same tyme, a plee at Avygnon before the Pope,
for the dysmes (<i>i.e.</i> tithes) of his churche, against a clerk, curate
there; the whiche priest was of Catelogne. He was a
grete clerk, and claymed to have ryghte of the dysmes, in the
towne of Corasse, which was valued to a hundred florens by
the yere, and the ryghte that he had, he shewed and proved
it; and, by sentence diffynitive, Pope Urbane the fythe, in
consistory generall, condempned the knighte, and gave judgement
wyth the preest, and of this last judgment he had letters
of the Pope, for his possession, and so rode tyll he came into
Berne, and there shewed his letters and bulles of the Popes
for his possession of his dysmes. The lord of Corasse had gret
indignacion at this preest, and came to hym, and said, 'Maister
Pers, or Maister Martin (as his name was) thinkest thou,
that by reason of thy letters I will lose mine herytage&mdash;be
nat so hardy, that thou take any thynge that is myne; if thou
do, it shall cost thee thy life. Go thy waye into some other
place to get thee a benefyce, for of myne herytage thou gettest
no parte, and ones for alwayes, I defende thee.' The
clerk douted the knight, for he was a cruell man, therefore he
durst nat parceyver.&mdash;Than he thoughte to return to Avignon,
as he dyde; but, whan he departed, he came to the knight,
the lord of Corasse, and sayd, 'Sir, by force, and nat by
ryght, ye take away from me the ryght of my churche, wherein
you greatly hurt your conscience.&mdash;I am not so strong in
this countrey as ye be; but, sir, knowe, for trouthe, that as
soon as I maye, I shall sende to you suche a champyon, whom
ye shall doubte more than me.' The knight, who doubted
nothyng his thretynges, said, 'God be with thee; do what
thou mayst; I doute no more dethe than lyfe; for all thy
wordes, I wyll not lese mine herytage.' Thus, the clerk departed
from the lord of Corasse, and went I cannot tell wheder
to Avygnon or into Catalogne, and forgat nat the promise
that he had made to the lord of Corasse or he departed.
For whan the knight thoughte leest on hym, about a three
monethes after, as the knyght laye on a nyght a-bedde in his
castelle of Corasse, with the lady, there came to hym messangers
invisible, and made a marvellous tempest and noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
in the castell, that it seemed as thoughe the castell shulde
have fallen downe, and strak gret strokes at his chambre
dore, that the goode ladye, his wife, was soore afrayde. The
knight herd alle, but he spoke no word thereof; bycause he
wolde shewe no abasshed corage, for he was hardy to abyde
all adventures. Thys noyse and tempest was in sundry places
of the castell, and dured a long space, and, at length, cessed
for that nyght. Than the nexte mornyng, all the servants of
the house came to the lord, whan he was risen, and sayd, 'Sir,
have you nat herde this night, that we have done?' The lord
dissembled, and sayd, 'No! I herd nothyng&mdash;what have you
herde?' Than they shewed him what noyse they hadde herde,
and howe alle the vessel in the kechyn was overtowrned.
Than the lord began to laugh, and sayd, 'Yea, sirs! ye dremed,
it was nothynge but the wynde.'&mdash;'In the name of
God!' quod the ladye, 'I herde it well.' The next nyght
there was as great noyse and greatter, and suche strokes gyven
at his chambre dore and windows, as alle shulde have
broken in pieces. The knyghte starte up out of his bedde,
and wolde not lette, to demaunde who was at his chambre
dore that tyme of the nyght; and anone he was answered by
a voyce that sayd, 'I am here.' Quod the knyght, 'Who
sent thee hyder?'&mdash;'The clerk of Catelogne sent me hyder,'
quod the voice, 'to whom thou dost gret wronge, for thou
hast taken from hym the ryghtes of his benefyce; I will nat
leave thee in rest tylle thou haste made hym a good accompte,
so that he be pleased.' Quod the knight, 'What is
thy name, that thou art so good a messangere?' Quod he, 'I
am called Orthone.'&mdash;'Orthone!' quod the knight, 'the servyce
of a clerke is lytell profyte for thee. He will putte
thee to moche payne if thou beleve hym. I pray thee leave
hym, and come and serve me; and I shall give thee goode
thanke.' Orthone was redy to aunswere, for he was inamours
with the knyghte, and sayde, 'Woldest thou fayne
have my servyce?'&mdash;'Yea, truly,' quod the knyghte, 'so thou
do no hurte to any persone in this house.'&mdash;'No more I will
do,' quod Orthone, 'for I have no power to do any <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>other
yvell, but to awake thee out of thy slepe, or some other.'&mdash;'Well,'
quod the knyght, 'do as I telle thee, and we shall
soone agree, and leave the yvill clerke, for there is no good
thyng in him, but to put thee to payne; therefore, come and
serve me.'&mdash;'Well,' quod Orthone, 'and sythe thou wilt have
me, we are agreed.'</p>

<p>"So this spyrite Orthone loved so the knight, that oftentymes
he wold come and vysyte hym, while he lay in his bedde
aslepe, and outher pull him by the eare, or els stryke at his
chambre dore or windowe. And, whan the knyght awoke,
than he wolde saye, 'Orthone, lat me slepe.'&mdash;'Nay,' quod
Orthone, 'that will I nat do, tyll I have shewed thee such
tydinges as are fallen a-late.' The ladye, the knyghtes wyfe,
wolde be sore afrayed, that her heer wald stand up, and
hyde herself under the clothes. Than the knyght wolde
saye, 'Why, what tidynges hast thou brought me?'&mdash;Quod
Orthone, 'I am come out of England, or out of Hungry, or
some other place, and yesterday I came hens, and such things
are fallen, or such other.' So thus the lord of Corasse knewe,
by Orthone, every thing that was done in any part of the
worlde. And in this case he contynued a fyve yere, and
could not kepe his own counsayle, but at last discovered it to
the Erle of Foiz. I shall shewe you howe.</p>

<p>"The firste yere, the lord of Corasse came on a day to Ortayse,
to the Erle of Foiz, and sayd to him, 'Sir, such things
are done in England, or in Scotland, or in Almagne, or in any
other countrey.' And ever the Erle of Foiz found his sayeing
true, and had great marveyle how he shulde knowe such
things so shortly. And, on a tyme the Erle of Foiz examined
him so straitly, that the lord of Corasse shewed hym alle
toguyder howe he knewe it, and howe he came to hym firste.
When the Erle of Foiz hard that, he was joyfull, and said,
Sir of Corasse, kepe him well in your love; I wolde I hadd
suche an messanger; he costeth you nothyng, and ye knowe
by him every thynge that is done in the worlde.' The knyght
answered, and sayd, 'Sir, that is true.' Thus, the lord of Corasse
was served with Orthone a long season. I can nat saye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
if this Orthone hadde any more masters or nat; but every
weke, twise or thrisse, he wolde come and vysite the lord of
Corasse, and wolde shewe hym such tidyngs of any thing
that was fallen fro whens he came. And ever the lord of
Corasse, when he knewe any thynge, he wrote thereof to the
Erle of Foiz, who had great joy thereof; for he was the lord,
of all the worlde, that most desyred to here news out of
straunge places. And, on a tyme, the lord of Corasse was
wyth the Erle of Foiz, and the erle demaunded of hym, and
sayd, 'Sir of Corasse, dyd ye ever as yet se your messengere?'&mdash;'Nay,
surely, sir,' quod the knyghte, 'nor I never
desyred it.'&mdash;'That is marveyle,' quod the erle; 'if I were
as well acquainted with him as ye be, I wolde have desyred
to have sene hym; wherefore, I pray you, desyre it of hym,
and then telle me what form and facyon he is of. I have
herd you say howe he speketh as good Gascon as outher you
or I.'&mdash;'Truely, sir,' quod the knyght, 'so it is: he speketh
as well, and as fayr, as any of us both do. And surely, sir,
sithe ye counsayle me, I shall do my payne to see him as I
can.' And so, on a night, as he lay in his bedde, with the
ladye his wife, who was so inured to here Orthone, that she
was no longer afrayd of him; than cam Orthone, and pulled
the lord by the eare, who was fast asleep, and therewith he
awoke, and asked who was there? 'I am here,' quod Orthone.
Then he demaunded, 'From whens comest thou
nowe?'&mdash;'I come,' quod Orthone, 'from Prague, in Eoesme.'&mdash;'How
farre is that hens?' quod the knyght. 'A threescore
days journey,' quod Orthone. 'And art thou come hens so
soon?' quod the knyght. 'Yea truely,' quod Orthone, 'I
come as fast as the wynde, or faster.'&mdash;'Hast thou than
winges?' quod the knyght. 'Nay, truely,' quod he. 'How
canst thou than flye so fast?' quod the knyght. 'Ye have
nothing to do to knowe that,' quod Orthone. 'No?' quod
the knyght, 'I wolde gladly se thee, to know what forme
thou art of.'&mdash;'Well,' quod Orthone, 'ye have nothing to do
to knowe: it sufficeth you to here me, and to shewe you tidynges.'&mdash;'In
faythe,' quod the knyght, 'I wolde love the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
moche better an I myght se thee ones.'&mdash;'Well,' quod Orthone,
'sir, sithe ye have so gret desyre to se me, the first
thynge that ye se to-morrowe, whan ye ryse out of your
bedde, the same shall be I.'&mdash;'That is sufficient,' quod the
lorde. 'Go thy way; I gyve thee leave to departe for this
nyght.' And the next mornynge the lord rose, and the ladye
his wyfe was so afrayd, that she durst not ryse, but fayned
herself sicke, and sayd she wolde not ryse. Her husband
wolde have had her to have rysen. 'Sir,' quod she, 'than
shall I se Orthone, and I wolde not se him by my gode
wille.'&mdash;'Well,' quod the knyght, 'I wolde gladly se hym.'
And so he arose, fayre and easily, out of his bedde, and sat
down on his bedde-syde, wenying to have sene Orthone in
his owne proper form; but he sawe nothynge wherbye he
myght saye, 'Lo, yonder is Orthone.' So that day past, and
the next night came, and when the knyght was in his bedde,
Orthone came, and began to speke, as he was accustomed. 'Go
thy waye,' quod the knyght, 'thou arte but a lyer; thou promysest
that I shuld have sene the, and it was not so.'&mdash;'No?'
quod he, 'and I shewed myself to the.'&mdash;'That is not so,'
quod the lord. 'Why,' quod Orthone, 'whan ye rose out of
your bedde, sawe ye nothynge?' Than the lorde studyed a
lytell, and advysed himself well. 'Yes, truely,' quod the
knyght, 'now I remember me, as I sate on my bedde-syde,
thynking on thee, I sawe two strawes upon the pavement,
tumblynge one upon another.'&mdash;'That same was I,' quod Orthone,
'into that fourme I dyd putte myself as than.'&mdash;'That
is not enough to me,' quod the lord; 'I pray thee putte thyselfe
into same other fourme, that I may better se and knowe
thee.'&mdash;'Well,' quod Orthone, 'ye will do so muche, that
ye will lose me, and I to go fro you, for ye desyre to moch
of me.'&mdash;'Nay,' quod the knyght, 'thou shalt not go fro
me, let me se thee ones, and I will desyre no more.'&mdash;'Well,'
quod Orthone, 'ye shall se me to-morrowe; take
hede, the first thyng that ye se after ye be out of your
chamber, it shall be I.'&mdash;'Well,' quod the knyght, 'I am
then content. Go thy way, lette me slepe.' And so Orth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>one
departed, and the next mornyng the lord arose, and
yssued oute of his chambre, and wente to a windowe, and
looked downe into the courte of the castell, and cast about
his eyen. And the firste thyng he sawe was a sowe, the
greattest that ever he sawe; and she seemed to be so leane
and yvell-favoured, that there was nothyng on her but the
skynne, and the bones, with long eares, and a long leane
snout. The lord of Corasse had marveyle of that leane sowe,
and was wery of the sighte of her, and comaunded his men
to fetch his houndes, and sayd, 'Let the dogges hunt her to
dethe, and devour her.' His servaunts opened the kenells,
and lette oute his houndes, and dyd sette them on this sowe.
And, at the last, the sowe made a great crye, and looked up
to the lord of Corasse as he looked out at a windowe, and so
sodaynely vanyshed awaye, no man wyste howe. Than the
lord of Corasse entred into his chambre, right pensyve, and
than he remembered hym of Orthone, his messangere, and
sayd, 'I repent me that I set my houndes on him. It is an
adventure, an I here any more of hym; for he sayd to me
oftentymes, that if I displeased hym, I shulde lose hym.'
The lord sayd trouthe, for never after he came into the castell
of Corasse, and also the knyght dyed the same yere next
followinge."</p>

<p>"So, sir," said the squyer, "thus have I shewed you the lyfe
of Orthone, and howe, for a season, he served the lord of
Corasse with newe tidynges."&mdash;"It is true, sir," sayd I, "but
nowe, as to your firste purpose. Is the Earl of Foiz served
with suche an messangere?"&mdash;"Surely," quod the squyer,
it is the ymaginacion of many, that he hath such messengers,
for ther is nothynge done in any place, but and he sette his
mynde thereto, he will knowe it, and whan men thynke leest
thereof. And so dyd he, when the goode knightes and squyers
of this country were slayne in Portugale at Juberothe. Some
saythe, the knowledge of such thynges hath done hym moche
profyte, for and there be but the value of a spone lost in his
house, anone he will know where it is.' So, thus, then I toke
leave of the squyer, and went to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>other company; but I bare
well away his tale."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bourchier's</span> <i>Translation of Froissart's

<p>The circumstance of Lord Soulis having thrown the key over
his left shoulder, and bid the fiend keep it till his return, is noted
in the introduction, as a part of his traditionary history. In
the course of this autumn (1806), the Earl of Dalkeith being
encamped near the Hermitage Castle, for the amusement of
shooting, directed some workmen to clear away the rubbish
from the door of the dungeon, in order to ascertain its ancient
dimensions and architecture. To the great astonishment of the
labourers, and of the country people who were watching their
proceedings, a rusty iron key, of considerable size, was found
among the ruins, a little way from the dungeon door. The
well-known tradition instantly passed from one to another; and
it was generally agreed, that the malevolent d&aelig;mon, who had
so long retained possession of the key of the castle, now found
himself obliged to resign it to the heir-apparent of the domain.
In the course of their researches, a large iron ladle, somewhat
resembling that used by plumbers, was also discovered; and
both the reliques are now in Lord Dalkeith's possession.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1805, another discovery was made in the
haunted ruins of Hermitage. In a recess of the wall of the
castle, intended apparently for receiving the end of a beam or
joist, a boy, seeking for birds nests, found a very curious antique
silver-ring, embossed with hearts, the well-known cognisance
of the Douglas family, placed interchangeably with
quatre-foils all round the circle. The workmanship has an uncommonly
rude and ancient appearance, and warrants our believing
that it may have belonged to one of the Earls of Angus,
who carried the heart and quatre-foils<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> in their arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
They parted with the castle and lordship of Liddesdale, in exchange
for that of Bothwell, in the beginning of the 16th century.
This ring is now in the editor's possession, by the obliging
gift of Mr John Ballantyne, of the house of Ballantyne
and Company, so distinguished for typography.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> As the people thronged to the execution of the gallant youth,
they were bitterly rebuked by Sir Ingram de Umfraville, an English
or Norman knight, then a favourite follower of Robert Bruce.
"Why press you," said he, "to see the dismal catastrophe of so
generous a knight? I have seen ye throng as eagerly around him
to share his bounty, as now to behold his death." With these
words he turned from the scene of blood, and, repairing to the king,
craved leave to sell his Scottish possessions, and to retire from the
country. "My heart," said Umfraville, "will not, for the wealth
of the world, permit me to dwell any longer, where I have seen
such a knight die by the hands of the executioner." With the
king's leave, he interred the body of David de Brechin, sold his
lands, and left Scotland for ever. The story is beautifully told by
Barbour, book 19th.</p></div>

<h3><a name="THE_COUT_OF_KEELDAR" id="THE_COUT_OF_KEELDAR">THE COUT OF KEELDAR.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY J. LEYDEN.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tradition on which the following ballad is founded,
derives considerable illustration from the argument of the
preceding. It is necessary to add, that the most redoubted
adversary of Lord Soulis was the Chief of Keeldar, a
Northumbrian district, adjacent to Cumberland, who perished
in a sudden encounter on the banks of the Hermitage.
Being arrayed in armour of proof, he sustained no
hurt in the combat; but stumbling in retreating across the
river, the hostile party held him down below water with
their lances till he died; and the eddy, in which he perished,
is still called the Cout of Keeldar's Pool. His
grave, of gigantic size, is pointed out on the banks of the
Hermitage, at the western corner of a wall, surrounding
the burial-ground of a ruined chapel. As an enemy of
Lord Soulis, his memory is revered; and the popular
epithet of <i>Cout</i>, <i>i.e.</i> Colt, is expressive of his strength,
stature, and activity. Tradition likewise relates, that the
young chief of Mangerton, to whose protection Lord Soulis
had, in some eminent jeopardy, been indebted for his
life, was decoyed by that faithless tyrant into his castle
of Hermitage, and insidiously murdered at a feast.</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></div>
<p>The Keeldar Stone, by which the Northumbrian chief
passed in his incursion, is still pointed out, as a boundary
mark, on the confines of Jed forest, and Northumberland.
It is a rough insulated mass, of considerable dimensions,
and it is held unlucky to ride thrice <i>withershins</i><a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> around
it. Keeldar Castle is now a hunting seat, belonging to
the Duke of Northumberland.</p>

<p>The <i>Brown Man of the Muirs</i> is a Fairy of the most
malignant order, the genuine <i>duergar</i>. Walsingham mentions
a story of an unfortunate youth, whose brains were
extracted from his skull, during his sleep, by this malicious
being. Owing to this operation, he remained insane
many years, till the virgin Mary courteously restored his
brains to their station.</p>

<h4>NOTES<br />

<span class="small">ON</span><br />

THE COUT OF KEELDAR.</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>'Tis formed of an earth-fast flint.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>An earth-fast stone, or an insulated stone, inclosed in a bed
of earth, is supposed to possess peculiar properties. It is frequently
applied to sprains and bruises, and used to dissipate
swellings; but its blow is reckoned uncommonly severe.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Of adderstone the hilt.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The adderstone, among the Scottish peasantry, is held in almost
as high veneration, as, among the Gauls, the <i>ovum anguinum</i>,
described by Pliny.&mdash;<i>Natural History</i>, l. xxix. c. 3. The
name is applied to celts, and other round perforated stones.
The vulgar suppose them to be perforated by the stings of
adders.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>With the leaves of the rowan tree.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_287">287</a>. v. 4.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The rowan tree, or mountain ash, is still used by the peasantry,
to avert the effects of charms and witchcraft. An inferior
degree of the same influence is supposed to reside in many
evergreens; as the holly, and the bay. With the leaves of
the bay, the English and Welch peasants were lately accustomed
to adorn their doors at midsummer.&mdash;Vide <span class="smcap">Brand</span>'s <i>Vulgar
Antiquities</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And shakes the rocking stone.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_291">291</a>. v. 1.</span>
</div></div>

<p>The rocking stone, commonly reckoned a Druidical monumen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>t,
has always been held in superstitious veneration by the
people. The popular opinion, which supposes them to be inhabited
by a spirit, coincides with that of the ancient Icelanders,
who worshipped the d&aelig;mons, which they believed to inhabit
great stones. It is related in the <i>Kristni Saga</i>, chap. 2.
that the first Icelandic bishop, by chaunting a hymn over one
of these sacred stones, immediately after his arrival in the
island, split it, expelled the spirit, and converted its worshippers
to Christianity. The herb vervain, revered by the Druids,
was also reckoned a powerful charm by the common people;
and the author recollects a popular rhyme, supposed to be addressed
to a young woman by the devil, who attempted to seduce
her in the shape of a handsome young man:</p>

<p>Castles, remarkable for size, strength, and antiquity, are, by
the common people, commonly attributed to the Picts, or Pechs,
who are not supposed to have trusted solely to their skill in
masonry, in constructing these edifices, but are believed to
have bathed the foundation-stone with human blood, in order
to propitiate the spirit of the soil. Similar to this is the Gaelic
tradition, according to which St Columba is supposed to have
been forced to bury St Oran alive, beneath the foundation of
his monastery, in order to propitiate the spirits of the soil, who
demolished by night what was built during the day.</p>

<p>To present a bull's head before a person at a feast, was, in

p. 17. that "efter the dinner was endit, once alle the delicate

<p>That alluded to in the following verse, is a wild fanciful popular

<p class="center">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The simple tradition, upon which the following stanzas
are founded, runs thus: While two Highland hunters were
passing the night in a solitary <i>bathy</i> (a hut, built for the
purpose of hunting), and making merry over their venison
and whisky, one of them expressed a wish, that they had
pretty lasses to complete their party. The words were
scarcely uttered, when two beautiful young women, habited
in green, entered the hut, dancing and singing.
One of the hunters was seduced by the syren, who attached
herself particularly to him, to leave the hut: the
other remained, and, suspicious of the fair seducers, continued
to play upon a trump, or Jew's harp, some strain,
consecrated to the Virgin Mary. Day at length came,
and the temptress vanished. Searching in the forest, he
found the bones of his unfortunate friend, who had been
torn to pieces and devoured by the fiend, into whose toils
he had fallen. The place was from thence called the
Glen of the Green Women.</p>
<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></div>
<p>Glenfinlas is a tract of forest-ground, lying in the Highlands
of Perthshire, not far from Callender, in Menteith.
It was formerly a royal forest, and now belongs to the
Earl of Moray. This country, as well as the adjacent
district of Balquidder, was, in times of yore, chiefly inhabited
by the Macgregors. To the west of the forest
of Glenfinlas lies Loch Katrine, and its romantic avenue,
called the Troshachs. Benledi, Benmore, and Benvoirlich,
are mountains in the same district, and at no
great distance from Glenfinlas. The river Teith passes
Callender and the castle of Doune, and joins the Forth
near Stirling. The pass of Lenny is immediately above
Callender, and is the principal access to the Highlands,
from that town. Glenartney is a forest, near Benvoirlich.
The whole forms a sublime tract of Alpine scenery.</p>

<p>This ballad first appeared in the <i>Tales of Wonder</i>.</p>

<p>I can only describe the second sight, by adopting Dr Johnson's

distant and future are perceived and seen as if they were present."
To which I would only add, that the spectral appearances,
thus presented, usually presage misfortune; that the faculty
is painful to those who suppose they possess it; and that
they usually acquire it, while themselves under the pressure of

</div></div>

<p>St Oran was a friend and follower of St Columba, and was
buried in Icolmkill. His pretensions to be a saint were rather
dubious. According to the legend, he consented to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>be buried
alive, in order to propitiate certain d&aelig;mons of the soil, who obstructed
the attempts of Columba to build a chapel. Columba
caused the body of his friend to be dug up, after three days
had elapsed; when Oran, to the horror and scandal of the assistants,
declared, that there was neither a God, a judgment,
nor a future state! He had no time to make further discoveries,
for Columba caused the earth once more to be shovelled
over him with the utmost dispatch. The chapel, however, and
the cemetery, was called <i>Reilig Ouran</i>; and, in memory of his
rigid celibacy, no female was permitted to pay her devotions,
or be buried, in that place. This is the rule alluded to in the
poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And thrice St Fillan's powerful prayer.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_316">316</a>. v. 5.</span>
</div></div>

<p>St Fillan has given his name to many chapels, holy fountains,
&amp;c. in Scotland. He was, according to Camerarius, an abbot
of Pittenweem, in Fife; from which situation he retired, and
died a hermit in the wilds of Glenurchy, A.D. 649. While engaged
in transcribing the Scriptures, his left hand was observed
to send forth such a splendour, as to afford light to that with
which he wrote; a miracle which saved many candles to the
convent, as St Fillan used to spend whole nights in that exercise.
The 9th of January was dedicated to this saint, who gave
his name to Kilfillan, in Renfrew, and St Phillans, or Forgend,
in Fife. Lesley, lib. 7., tells us, that Robert the Bruce was
possessed of Fillan's miraculous and luminous arm, which he
inclosed in a silver shrine, and had it carried at the head of his
army. Previous to the battle of Bannockburn, the king's chaplain,
a man of little faith, abstracted the relique, and deposited
it in some place of security, lest it should fall into the hands
of the English. But, lo! while Robert was addressing his
prayers to the empty casket, it was observed to open and shut
suddenly; and, on inspection, the saint was found to have himself
deposited his arm in the shrine, as an assurance of victory.
Such is the tale of Lesley. But though Bruce little needed that
the arm of St Fillan should assist his own, he dedicated to him,
in gratitude, a priory at Killin, upon Loch Tay.</p>

<p>In the Scots Magazine for July 1802, (a national periodical
publication, which has lately revived with considerable energy,)
there is a copy of a very curious crown grant, dated 11th July,
1487, by which James III. confirms to Malice Doire, an inhabitant
of Strathfillan, in Perthshire, the peaceable exercise and
enjoyment of a relique of St Fillan, called the Quegrich, which
he, and his predecessors, are said to have possessed since the
days of Robert Bruce. As the Quegrich was used to cure diseases,
this document is, probably, the most ancient patent ever
granted for a quack medicine. The ingenious correspondent,
by whom it is furnished, further observes, that additional particulars,
concerning St Fillan, are to be found in <i>Ballenden's
Boece</i>, Book 4. folio ccxiii., and in <span class="smcap">Pennant</span>'s <i>Tour in Scotland</i>,

<h3><a name="THE_MERMAID" id="THE_MERMAID">THE MERMAID.</a></h3>

<p class="center">J. LEYDEN.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The following poem is founded upon a Gaelic traditional
ballad, called <i>Macphail of Colonsay, and the Mermaid of
Corrivrekin</i>. The dangerous gulf of Corrivrekin lies between
the islands of Jura and Scarba, and the superstition
of the islanders has tenanted its shelves and eddies with all
the fabulous monsters and d&aelig;mons of the ocean. Among
these, according to a universal tradition, the Mermaid is
the most remarkable. In her dwelling, and in her appearance,
the mermaid of the northern nations resembles
the syren of the ancients. The appendages of a comb and
mirror are probably of Celtic invention.</p>

<p>The Gaelic story bears, that Macphail of Colonsay was
carried off by a mermaid, while passing the gulf above
mentioned: that they resided together, in a grotto beneath
the sea, for several years, during which time she
bore him five children: but, finally, he tired of her society,
and, having prevailed upon her to carry him near
the shore of Colonsay, he escaped to land.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the Isle of Man have a number of
such stories, which may be found in Waldron. One bears,
that a very beautiful mermaid fell in love with a young
shepherd, who kept his flocks beside a creek, much frequented
by these marine people. She frequently caressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
him, and brought him presents of coral, fine pearls,
and every valuable production of the ocean. Once upon
a time, as she threw her arms eagerly round him, he suspected
her of a design to draw him into the sea, and,
struggling hard, disengaged himself from her embrace,
and ran away. But the mermaid resented either the suspicion,
or the disappointment, so highly, that she threw a
stone after him, and flung herself into the sea, whence
she never returned. The youth, though but slightly struck
with the pebble, felt, from that moment, the most excruciating
agony, and died at the end of seven days.&mdash;<i>Waldron's
Works</i>, p. 176.</p>

<p>Another tradition of the same island affirms, that one
of these amphibious damsels was caught in a net, and
brought to land, by some fishers, who had spread a snare
for the denizens of the ocean. She was shaped like the
most beautiful female down to the waist, but below trailed
a voluminous fish's tail, with spreading fins. As she
would neither eat nor speak, (though they knew she had
the power of language), they became apprehensive that
the island would be visited with some strange calamity, if
she should die for want of food; and therefore, on the
third night, they left the door open, that she might escape.
Accordingly, she did not fail to embrace the opportunity;
but, gliding with incredible swiftness to the
sea-side, she plunged herself into the waters, and was
welcomed by a number of her own species, who were
heard to enquire, what she had seen among the natives
of the earth; "Nothing," she answered, "won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>derful, except
that they were silly enough to throw away the
water in which they had boiled their eggs."</p>

<p>Collins, in his notes upon the line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mona, long hid from those who sail the main,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>explains it, by a similar Celtic tradition. It seems, a
mermaid had become so much charmed with a young
man, who walked upon the beach, that she made love to
him; and, being rejected with scorn, she excited, by enchantment,
a mist, which long concealed the island from
all navigators.</p>

<p>I must mention another Mankish tradition, because,
being derived from the common source of Celtic mythology,
they appear the most natural illustrations of the Hebridean
tale. About fifty years before Waldron went to
reside in Man (for there were living witnesses of the legend,
when he was upon the island), a project was undertaken,
to fish treasures up from the deep, by means of a
diving-bell. A venturous fellow, accordingly, descended,
and kept pulling for more rope, till all they had on board
was expended. This must have been no small quantity,
for a skilful mathematician, who was on board, judging
from the proportion of line let down, declared, that the
adventurer must have descended at least double the number
of leagues which the moon is computed to be distant
from the earth. At such a depth, wonders might be expected,
and wonderful was the account given by the adventurer,
when drawn up to the air.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></div>

<p>"After," said he, "I had passed the region of fishes,
I descended into a pure element, clear as the air in the
serenest and most unclouded day, through which, as I
passed, I saw the bottom of the watery world, paved
with coral, and a shining kind of pebbles, which glittered
like the sun-beams, reflected on a glass. I longed
to tread the delightful paths, and never felt more exquisite
delight, than when the machine, I was inclosed
in, grazed upon it.</p>

<p>"On looking through the little windows of my prison,
I saw large streets and squares on every side, ornamented
with huge pyramids of crystal, not inferior in brightness
to the finest diamonds; and the most beautiful
building, not of stone, nor brick, but of mother-of-pearl,
and embossed in various figures, with shells of all colours.
The passage, which led to one of these magnificent
apartments, being open, I endeavoured, with my
whole strength, to move my enclosure towards it; which
I did, though with great difficulty, and very slowly. At
last, however, I got entrance into a very spacious room,
in the midst of which stood a large amber table, with
several chairs round, of the same. The floor of it was
composed of rough diamonds, topazes, emeralds, rubies,
and pearls. Here I doubted not but to make my voyage
as profitable as it was pleasant; for, could I have
brought with me but a few of these, they would have
been of more value than all we could hope for in a thousand
wrecks; but they were so closely wedged in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
so strongly cemented by time, that they were not to be
unfastened. I saw several chains, carcanets, and rings, of
all manner of precious stones, finely cut, and set after
our manner; which I suppose had been the prize of the
winds and waves: these were hanging loosely on the
jasper walls, by strings made of rushes, which I might
easily have taken down; but, as I had edged myself
within half a foot reach of them, I was unfortunately
drawn back through your want of line. In my return,
I saw several comely <i>mermen</i>, and beautiful <i>mermaids</i>,
the inhabitants of this blissful realm, swiftly descending
towards it; but they seemed frighted at my appearance,
and glided at a distance from me, taking me, no doubt,
for some monstrous and new-created species."&mdash;<i>Waldron</i>,
<i>ibidem</i>.</p>

<p>It would be very easy to enlarge this introduction, by
quoting a variety of authors, concerning the supposed existence
of these marine people. The reader may consult
the <i>Telliamed</i> of M. Maillet, who, in support of the Neptunist
system of geology, has collected a variety of legends,
respecting mermen and mermaids, p. 230, <i>et sequen.</i>
Much information may also be derived from Pontoppidan's
<i>Natural History of Norway</i>, who fails not to
people her seas with this amphibious race.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> An older
authority is to be found in the <i>Kongs skugg-sio</i>, or Royal
Mirror, written, as it is believed, about 1170. The mermen,
there mentioned, are termed <i>hafstrambur</i> (sea-giants),
and are said to have the upper parts resembling <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>the human
race; but the author, with becoming diffidence, declines
to state, positively, whether they are equipped with
a dolphin's tail. The female monster is called <i>Mar-Gyga</i>
(sea-giantess), and is averred, certainly, to drag a fish's
train. She appears, generally, in the act of devouring
fish, which she has caught. According to the apparent
voracity of her appetite, the sailors pretended to guess
what chance they had of saving their lives in the tempests,
which always followed her appearance.&mdash;<i>Speculum
Regale</i>, 1768, p. 166.</p>

<p>Mermaids were sometimes supposed to be possessed of
supernatural powers. Resenius, in his life of Frederick II.,
gives us an account of a syren, who not only prophesied
future events, but, as might have been expected from the
element in which she dwelt, preached vehemently against
the sin of drunkenness.</p>

<p>The mermaid of Corrivrekin possessed the power of occasionally
resigning her scaly train; and the Celtic tradition
bears, that when, from choice or necessity, she was
invested with that appendage, her manners were more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>stern and savage than when her form was entirely human.
Of course, she warned her lover not to come into her presence,
when she was thus transformed. This belief is alluded
to in the following ballad.</p>

<p>The beauty of the syrens is celebrated in the old romances
of chivalry. Doolin, upon beholding, for the first
time in his life, a beautiful female, exclaims, "<i>Par sainte
Marie, si belle creature ne vis je oncque en ma vie! Je
crois que c'est un ange du ciel, ou une seraine de mer; Je
crois que homme n'engendra oncque si belle creature.</i>"&mdash;La
Fleur de Battailles.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The sea-snake heave his snowy mane.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_334">334</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"They, who, in works of navigation, on the coasts of Norway,
employ themselves in fishing or merchandize, do all
agree in this strange story, that there is a serpent there, which
is of a vast magnitude, namely, two hundred feet long, and
moreover twenty feet thick; and is wont to live in rocks
and caves, toward the sea-coast about Berge; which will go
alone from his holes, in a clear night in summer, and devours
calves, lambs, and hogs; or else he goes into the sea
to feed on polypus, locusts, and all sorts of sea-crabs. He
hath commonly hair hanging from his neck a cubit long,
and sharp scales, and is black, and he hath flaming shining
eyes. This snake disquiets the skippers, and he puts up his
head on high, like a pillar, and catcheth away men, and he
devours them; and this hapneth not but it signifies some
wonderful change of the kingdom near at hand; namely,
that the princes shall die, or be banished; or some tumultuous
wars shall presentlie follow."&mdash;<i>Olaus Magnus</i>, London,
1558, rendered into English by J. S. Much more of the
sea-snake may be learned from the credible witnesses cited
by Pontoppidan, who saw it raise itself from the sea, twice as
high as the mast of their vessel. The tradition probably originates
in the immense snake of the Edda, whose folds were
supposed to girdle the earth.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LORD_HERRIES_HIS_COMPLAINT" id="THE_LORD_HERRIES_HIS_COMPLAINT">THE LORD HERRIES HIS COMPLAINT,</a></h3>

<p class="center">A FRAGMENT.</p>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>

<p class="center">BY CHARLES KIRKPATRICK SHARPE, ESQ.
OF HODDOM.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hoddom castle is delightfully situated on the banks of
the river Annan. It is an ancient structure, said to have
been built betwixt the years 1437 and 1484, by John
Lord Herries, of Herries, a powerful border baron, who
possessed extensive domains in Dumfries-shire. This family
continued to flourish until the death of William, Lord
Herries, in the middle of the 16th century, when it merged
in heirs female. Agnes, the eldest of the daughters of
Lord William, was married to John, master of Maxwell,
afterwards created Lord Herries, and a strenuous partizan
of Queen Mary. The castle and barony of Hoddom were
sold, about 1630, and were then, or soon afterwards, acquired
by John Sharpe, Esq., in whose family they have
ever since continued. Before the accession of James VI.
to the English crown, Hoddom castle was appointed to be
kept "with ane wise stout man, and to have with him
four well-horsed men, and there to have two stark footmen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>servants, to keep their horses, and the principal to
have ane stout footman."&mdash;<i>Border Laws, Appendix.</i></p>

<p>On the top of a small, but conspicuous hill, near to
Hoddom castle, there is a square tower, built of hewn
stone, over the door of which are carved the figures of a
dove and a serpent, and betwixt them the word <i>Repentance</i>.
Hence the building, though its proper name is
Trailtrow, is more frequently called the Tower of Repentance.
It was anciently used as a beacon, and the border
laws direct a watch to be maintained there, with a fire-pan
and bell, to give the alarm when the English crossed,
or approached, the river Annan. This man was to have
a husband-land for his service.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Spottiswoode</span>, p. 306.</p>

<p>Various accounts are given of the cause of erecting the
Tower of Repentance. The following has been adopted
by my ingenious correspondent, as most susceptible of
poetical decoration. A certain Lord Herries&mdash;about the
date of the transaction, tradition is silent&mdash;was famous
among those who used to rob and steal (<i>convey</i>, the wise
it call). This lord, returning from England, with many
prisoners, whom he had unlawfully enthralled, was overtaken
by a storm, while passing the Solway Firth, and, in
order to relieve his boat, he cut all their throats, and
threw them into the sea. Feeling great qualms of conscience,
he built this square tower, carving over the door,
which is about half way up the building, and had formerly
no stair to it, the figures above mentioned, of a dove
and a serpent, emblems of remorse and grace, and the
motto&mdash;"<i>Repentance.</i>"</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></div>

<p>I have only to add, that the marauding baron is said,
from his rapacity, to have been surnamed John the Reif;
probably in allusion to a popular romance; and that
another account says, the sin, of which he repented, was
the destruction of a church, or chapel, called Trailtrow,
with the stones of which he had built the castle of Hoddom.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Macfarlane</span>'s
MSS.</p>

<p>It is said, that Sir Richard Steele, while riding near this
place, saw a shepherd boy reading his Bible, and asked

the shepherd; and he pointed to the tower of "<i>Repentance</i>."</p>

<h3><a name="THE_MURDER_OF_CAERLAVEROC" id="THE_MURDER_OF_CAERLAVEROC">THE MURDER OF CAERLAVEROC.</a></h3>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.</p>

<p class="center">BY CHARLES KIRKPATRICK SHARPE, ESQ.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tragical event which preceded, or perhaps gave rise
to, the successful insurrection of Robert Bruce, against the
tyranny of Edward I., is well known. In the year 1304,
Bruce abruptly left the court of England, and held an interview,
in the Dominical church of Dumfries, with John,
surnamed, from the colour of his hair, the Red Cuming, a
powerful chieftain, who had formerly held the regency of
Scotland. It is said, by the Scottish historians, that he
upbraided Cuming with having betrayed to the English
monarch a scheme, formed betwixt them, for asserting the
independence of Scotland. The English writers maintain,
that Bruce proposed such a plan to Cuming, which
he rejected with scorn, as inconsistent with the fealty he
had sworn to Edward. The dispute, however it began, soon
waxed high betwixt two fierce and independent barons.
At length, standing before the high altar of the church,
Cuming gave Bruce the lie, and Bruce retaliated by a
stroke of his poniard. Full of confusion and remorse, for
a homicide committed in a sanctuary, the future monarch
of Scotland rushed out of the church, with the bloody poniard
in his hand. Kirkpatrick and Lindsay, two barons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
who faithfully adhered to him, were waiting at the gate.
To their earnest and anxious enquiries into the cause of his
emotion, Bruce answered, "I doubt I have slain the Red
Cuming".&mdash;"Doubtest thou?" exclaimed Kirkpatrick,
"I make sure!"<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Accordingly, with Lindsay and a few
followers, he rushed into the church, and dispatched the
wounded Cuming.</p>

<p>A homicide, in such a place, and such an age, could
hardly escape embellishment from the fertile genius of the
churchmen, whose interest was so closely connected with
the inviolability of a divine sanctuary. Accordingly, Bowmaker
informs us, that the body of the slaughtered baron
was watched, during the night, by the Dominicans, with
the usual rites of the church. But, at midnight, the
whole assistants fell into a dead sleep, with the exception
of one aged father, who heard, with terror and surprise,
a voice, like that of a wailing infant, exclaim, "How
long, O Lord, shall vengeance be deferred?" it was answered,
in an awful tone, "Endure with patience, until
the anniversary of this day shall return for the fifty-second
time." In the year 1357, fifty-two years after
Cuming's death, James of Lindsay was hospitably feasted
in the castle of Caerlaveroc, in Dumfries-shire, belonging
to Roger Kirkpatrick. They were the sons of the murderers
of the regent. In the dead of night, for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>unknown cause, Lindsay arose, and poniarded in his bed
his unsuspecting host. He then mounted his horse to
fly; but guilt and fear had so bewildered his senses, that,
after riding all night, he was taken, at break of day, not
three miles from the castle, and was afterwards executed,
by order of King David II.</p>

<p>The story of the murder is thus told by the prior of
Lochlevin:&mdash;</p>

<h3><a name="WATER_KELPIE" id="WATER_KELPIE">WATER KELPIE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED&mdash;REV. DR JAMIESON.</p>



<hr class="tb" />

<p>The principal design of the author of this piece, was to
give a specimen of Scottish writing, more nearly approaching
to the classical compositions of our ancient bards, than
that which has been generally followed for seventy or
eighty years past. As the poem is descriptive of the superstitions
of the vulgar, in the county of Angus, the scene
is laid on the banks of South Esk, near the castle of Inverquharity,
about five miles north from Forfar.</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that the editor announces to the literary
world, that Dr Jamieson is about to publish a complete
Dictionary of the Scottish Dialect; his intimate acquaintance
with which is evinced in the following stanzas.</p>

<h4>NOTES<br />

<span class="small">ON<br /></span>

WATER KELPIE.</h4>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>The fisher's houp forgat to loup.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="center">The fishes, the hope of the angler, no more rose to the fly.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And aw for rest made boun.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><i>All</i> commonly occurs in our old writers. But <i>aw</i> is here
used, as corresponding with the general pronunciation in Scotland;
especially as it has the authority of Dunbar, in his <i>Lament
for the Deth of the Makaris</i>.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>His form a gaist uprear'd.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_385">385</a>. v. 8.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is believed in Angus, that the spirit of the waters appears
sometimes as a man, with a very frightful aspect; and, at other
times, as a horse. The description, here given, must therefore
be viewed as the offspring of fancy. All that can be said for it
is, that such attributes are selected as are appropriate to the
scenery.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Twa huge horse-mussells glar'd.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_386">386</a>. v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>South-Esk abounds with the fresh water oyster, vulgarly
called the horse-mussel; and, in former times, a pearl fishery
was carried on here to considerable extent.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Frae yon deep glack, at Catla's back.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_387">387</a>. v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Part of the Grampian mountains. <i>Catla</i> appears as a promontory,
jutting out from the principal ridge, towards the plain.
Th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>e Esk, if I recollect right, issues from behind it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Thy mortal life to tyne.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_387">387</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The vulgar idea is, that a spirit, however frequently it appear,
will not speak, unless previously addressed. It is, however,
at the same time believed, that the person, who ventures
to speak to a ghost, will soon forfeit his life, in consequence of
his presumption.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>His bridle frae my mow.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_388">388</a>. v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The popular tradition is here faithfully described; and, strange
to tell! has not yet lost all credit. In the following verses, the
principal articles of the vulgar creed in Angus, with respect to
this supposed being, are brought together and illustrated by
such <i>facts</i> as are yet appealed to by the credulous. If I mistake
not, none of the historical circumstances mentioned are
older than half a century. It is only about thirty years since
the bridge referred to was built.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>For sair-brizz'd back and banes.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_388">388</a>. v. 2.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is pretended that <i>Kelpie</i> celebrated this memorable event
in rhyme; and that for a long time after he was often heard to
cry, with a doleful voice,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sair back and sair banes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carryin' the laird of Murphy's stanes."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>And it thai Kelpie namit.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_388">388</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A head, like that of a gorgon, appears above the arch of the
bridge. This was hewn in honour of Kelpie.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>His shroud I had prepar'd.</i>&mdash;P. <a href="#Page_390">390</a>. v. 3.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A very common tale in Scotland is here alluded to by the
poet. On the banks of a rapid stream the water spirit was
heard repeatedly to exclaim, in a dismal tone, "The hour is
come, but not the man;" when a person coming up, contrary
to all remonstrances, endeavoured to ford the stream, and perished
in the attempt. The original story is to be found in
Gervase of Tilbury.&mdash;In the parish of Castleton, the same story
is told, with this variation, that the by-standers prevented,
by force, the predestined individual from entering the river,
and shut him up in the church, where he was next morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
found suffocated, with his face lying immersed in the baptismal
font. To a <i>fey</i> person, therefore, Shakespeare's words literally
apply:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">---- Put but a little water in a spoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it shall be as all the ocean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to swallow such a being up.<br /></span>

<h3><a name="ELLANDONAN_CASTLE" id="ELLANDONAN_CASTLE">ELLANDONAN CASTLE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">A HIGHLAND TALE.</p>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.&mdash;- COLIN
MACKENZIE, ESQ.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ellandonan Castle stands on a small rocky isle, situated
in Loch Duich (on the west coast of Ross), near the
point where the western sea divides itself into two branches,
forming Loch Duich and Loch Loung. The magnificence
of the castle itself, now a roofless ruin, covered with ivy,
the beauty of the bay, and the variety of hills and valleys
that surround it, and particularly the fine range of hills,
between which lie the pastures of Glensheal, with the lofty
summit of Skooroora, overtopping the rest, and forming
a grand back-ground to the picture; all contribute to
make this a piece of very romantic Highland scenery.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The castle is the manor-place of the estate of Kintail,
which is denominated the barony of Ellandonan. That
estate is the property of Francis, Lord Seaforth. It has
descended to him, through a long line of gallant ancestors;
having been originally conferred on Colin Fitzgerald, son
to the Earl of Desmond and Kildare, in the kingdom of
Ireland, by a charter, dated 9th January, 1266, granted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>by King Alexander the third, "<i>Colino Hybernio</i>," and
bearing, as its inductive cause, "<i>pro bono et fideli servitio,
tam in bello, quam in pace</i>." He had performed a very
recent service in war, having greatly distinguished himself
in the battle of Largs, in 1263, in which the invading
army of Haco, King of Norway, was defeated. Being
pursued in his flight, the king was overtaken in the narrow
passage which divides the island of Skye from the
coasts of Inverness and Ross, and, along with many of his
followers, he himself was killed, in attempting his escape
through the channel dividing Skye from Lochalsh. These
straits, or <i>kyles</i>, bear to this day appellations, commemorating
the events by which they were thus distinguished,
the former being called Kyle Rhee, or the King's Kyle,
and the latter Kyle Haken.</p>

<p>The attack on Ellandonan Castle, which forms the subject
of the following poem, lives in the tradition of the
country, where it is, at this day, a familiar tale, repeated
to every stranger, who, in sailing past, is struck with admiration
at the sight of that venerable monument of antiquity.
But the authenticity of the fact rests not solely
on tradition. It is recorded, by Crawford, in his account
of the family of Macdonald, Lord of the Isles, and reference
is there made to a genealogy of Slate, in the possession of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>the family, as a warrant for the assertion. The incident
took place in 1537.</p>

<p>The power of the Lord of the Isles was at that time sufficiently
great to give alarm to the crown. It covered not
only the whole of the Western Isles, from Bute northwards,
but also many extensive districts on the main-land,
in the shires of Ayr, Argyle, and Inverness. Accordingly,
in 1535, on the failure of heirs-male of the body of
John, Lord of the Isles, and Earl of Ross, as well as of two
of his natural sons, in whose favour a particular substitution
had been made, King James the fifth assumed the
lordship of the Isles. The right was, however, claimed
by Donald, fifth baron of Slate, descended from the immediate
younger brother of John, Lord of the Isles. This
bold and high-spirited chieftain lost his life in the attack
on Ellandonan Castle, and was buried by his followers
on the lands of Ardelve, on the opposite side of Loch
Loung.</p>

<p>The barony of Ellandonan then belonged to John Mackenzie,
ninth baron of Kintail. Kenneth, third baron,
who was son to Kenneth, the son of Colin Fitzgerald, received
the patronimic appellation of <i>Mac</i> Kenneth, or
Mac Kennye, which descended from him to his posterity,
as the sirname of the family. John, baron of Kintail,
took a very active part in the general affairs of the kingdom.
He fought gallantly at the battle of Flodden, under
the banners of King James the fourth, was a member
of the privy council in the re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>ign of his son, and, at an advanced
age, supported the standard of the unfortunate
Mary, at the battle of Pinkie.</p>

<p>In the sixth generation from John, baron of Kintail, the
clan was, by his lineal descendant, William, fifth earl of
Seaforth, summoned, in 1715, to take up arms in the cause
of the house of Stuart. On the failure of that spirited, but
ill-fated enterprize, the earl made his escape to the continent,
where he lived for about eleven years. Meantime
his estate and honours were forfeited to the crown, and
his castle was burnt. A steward was appointed to levy
the rents of Kintail, on the king's behalf; but the vassals
spurned at his demands, and, while they carried on a
successful defensive war, against a body of troops sent to
subdue their obstinacy, in the course of which the unlucky
steward had the misfortune to be slain, one of their
number made a faithful collection of what was due, and
carried the money to the earl himself, who was at that
time in Spain. The descendants of the man, to whom
it was entrusted to convey to his lord this unequivocal
proof of the honour, fidelity, and attachment of his people,
are at this day distinguished by the designation of <i>Spaniard</i>;
as Duncan, <i>the Spaniard</i>, &amp;c. The estate was, a
few years after the forfeiture, purchased from government,
for behoof of the family, and re-invested in the person of
his son.</p>

<h3><a name="CADYOW_CASTLE" id="CADYOW_CASTLE">CADYOW CASTLE.</a></h3>

<p class="center">BY THE EDITOR.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ruins of Cadyow, or Cadzow Castle, the ancient baronial
residence of the family of Hamilton, are situated
upon the precipitous banks of the river Evan, about two
miles above its junction with the Clyde. It was dismantled,
in the conclusion of the civil wars, during the reign
of the unfortunate Mary, to whose cause the house of
Hamilton devoted themselves with a generous zeal, which
occasioned their temporary obscurity, and, very nearly,
their total ruin. The situation of the ruins, embosomed
in wood, darkened by ivy and creeping shrubs, and overhanging
the brawling torrent, is romantic in the highest
degree. In the immediate vicinity of Cadyow is a grove
of immense oaks, the remains of the Caledonian Forest,
which anciently extended through the south of Scotland,
from the eastern to the Atlantic Ocean. Some of these
trees measure twenty-five feet, and upwards, in circumference;
and the state of decay, in which they now appear,
shews, that they may have witnessed the rites of the
Druids.&mdash;The whole scenery is included in the magnificent
and extensive park of the Duke of Hamilton. There
was long preserved in this forest the breed of the Scottish
wild cattle, until their ferocity occasioned their being extirpated,
about forty years ago. Their appearance was
beautiful, being milk-white, with black muzzles, horns,
and hoofs. The bulls are described by ancient aut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>hors,
as having white manes; but those of latter days had lost
that peculiarity, perhaps by intermixture with the tame
breed.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>In detailing the death of the regent Murray, which is
made the subject of the following ballad, it would be injustice
to my reader to use other words than those of Dr
Robertson, whose account of that memorable event forms
a beautiful piece of historical painting.</p>

<p>"Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh was the person who committed
this barbarous action. He had been condemned
to death soon after the battle of Langside, as we have
already related, and owed his life to the regent's clemency.
But part of his estate had been bestowed upon
one of the regent's favourites,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> who seized his house,
and turned out his wife, naked, in a cold night, into the
open fields, where, before next morning, she became furiously
mad. This injury made a deeper impression on
him than the benefit he had received, and from that moment
he vowed to be revenged of the regent. Party
rage strengthened and inflamed his private resentment.
His kinsmen, the Hamiltons, applauded the enterprize.
The maxims of that age justified the most desperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>course he could take to obtain vengeance. He followed
the regent for some time, and watched for an opportunity
to strike the blow. He resolved, at last, to wait
till his enemy should arrive at Linlithgow, through
which he was to pass, in his way from Stirling to Edinburgh.
He took his stand in a wooden gallery,<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> which
had a window towards the street; spread a feather-bed
on the floor, to hinder the noise of his feet from being
heard; hung up a black cloth behind him, that his shadow
might not be observed from without; and, after all
this preparation, calmly expected the regent's approach,
who had lodged, during the night, in a house not far
distant. Some indistinct information of the danger
which threatened him had been conveyed to the regent,
and he paid so much regard to it, that he resolved
to return by the same gate through which he had entered,
and to fetch a compass round the town. But, as the
crowd about the gate was great, and he himself unacquainted
with fear, he proceeded directly along the
street; and the throng of people obliging him to move
very slowly, gave the assassin time to take so true an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>aim, that he shot him, with a single bullet, through the
lower part of his belly, and killed the horse of a gentleman,
who rode on his other side. His followers instantly
endeavoured to break into the house, whence the
blow had come; but they found the door strongly barricaded,
and, before it could be forced open, Hamilton
had mounted a fleet horse,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> which stood ready for him
at a back-passage, and was got far beyond their reach.
The regent died the same night of his wound."&mdash;<i>History
of Scotland</i>, book v.</p>

<p>Bothwellhaugh rode straight to Hamilton, where he was
received in triumph; for the ashes of the houses in Clydesdale,
which had been burned by Murray's army, were yet
smoking; and party prejudice, the habits of the age, and
the enormity of the provocation, seemed, to his kinsmen,
to justify his deed. After a short abode at Hamilton, this
fierce and determined man left Scotland, and served in
France, under the patronage of the family of Guise, to
whom he was doubtless recommended by having avenged
the cause of their niece, Queen Mary, upon her ungrateful
brother. De Thou has recorded, that an attempt
was made to engage him to assassinate Gaspar de Coligni,
the famous admiral of France, and the buckler of the
Huguenot cause. But the character of Bothwellhaugh
was mistaken. He was no mercenary trader in blood,
and rejected the offer with contempt and indignation. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>had no authority, he said, from Scotland, to commit murders
in France; he had avenged his own just quarrel, but
he would neither, for price nor prayer, avenge that of another
man.&mdash;<i>Thaunus</i>, cap. 46.</p>

<p>The regent's death happened 23d January, 1569. It
is applauded or stigmatized, by contemporary historians,
according to their religious or party prejudices. The
triumph of Blackwood is unbounded. He not only extols
the pious feat of Bothwellhaugh, "who," he observes,
"satisfied, with a single ounce of lead, him, whose sacrilegious
avarice had stripped the metropolitan church of
St Andrew's of its covering;" but he ascribes it to immediate
divine inspiration, and the escape of Hamilton to
little less than the miraculous interference of the Deity.&mdash;<i>Jebb</i>,
Vol. II. p. 263. With equal injustice, it was, by
others, made the ground of a general national reflection;
for, when Mather urged Berney to assassinate Burleigh,
and quoted the examples of Poltrot and Bothwellhaugh,
the other conspirator answered, "that neyther Poltrot
nor Hambleton did attempt their enterpryse, without
some reason or consideration to lead them to it; as the
one, by hyre, and promise of preferment or rewarde;
the other, upon desperate mind of revenge, for a lytle
wrong done unto him, as the report goethe, accordinge
to the vyle trayterous dysposysyon of the hoole natyon
of the Scottes."&mdash;<i>Murdin's State Papers</i>, Vol. I. p. 197.</p>

James, Earl of Arran, Duke of Chatelherault, in France, and

<p>Lord Claud Hamilton, second son of the Duke of Chatelherault,
and commendator of the abbey of Paisley, acted a distinguished
part during the troubles of Queen Mary's reign, and
remained unalterably attached to the cause of that unfortunate
princess. He led the van of her army at the fatal battle of
Langside, and was one of the commanders at the Raid of Stirling,
which had so nearly given complete success to the queen's
faction. He was ancestor of the present Marquis of Abercorn.</p>

<p>This barony, stretching along the banks of the Esk, near Auchindinny,
belonged to Bothwellhaugh, in right of his wife.
The ruins of the mansion, from whence she was expelled in the
brutal manner which occasioned her death, are still to be seen
in a hollow glen beside the river. Popular report tenants them
with the restless ghost of the lady Bothwellhaugh; whom, however,
it confounds with Lady Anne Bothwell, whose <i>Lament</i>
is so popular. This spectre is so tenacious of her rights, that,
a part of the stones of the ancient edifice having been employed
in building or repairing the present Woodhouselee, she
has deemed it a part of her privilege to haunt that house also;
and, even of very late years, has excited considerable disturbance
and terror among the domestics. This is a more remarkable
vindication of the <i>rights of ghosts</i>, as the present Woodhouselee,
which gives his title to the honourable Alexander
Fraser Tytler, a senator of the college of justice, is situated on
the slope of the Pentland hills, distant at least four miles from
her proper abode. She always appears in white, and with her
child in her arms.</p>

<p>The carbine, with which the regent was shot, is preserved at
Hamilton palace. It is a brass piece, of a middling length, very
small in the bore, and, what is rather extraordinary, appears
to have been rifled or indented in the barrel. It had a matchlock,
for which a modern fire-lock has been injudiciously substituted.</p>

</div></div>

<p>This clan of Lennox Highlanders were attached to the regent
Murray. Holinshed, speaking of the battle of Langsyde, says,
"in this batayle the valiancie of an hieland gentleman, named
Macfarlane, stood the regent's part in great steede; for, in
the hottest brunte of the fighte, he came up with two hundred
of his friendes and countrymen, and so manfully gave in upon
the flankes of the queen's people, that he was a great cause
of the disordering of them. This Macfarlane had been lately
before, as I have heard, condemned to die, for some outrage
by him committed, and obtayning pardon through suyte of
the Countesse of Murray, he recompenced that clemencie by
this piece of service now at this batayle." Calderwood's account
is less favourable to the Macfarlanes. He states that
"Macfarlane, with his highlandmen, fled from the wing where
they were set. The Lord Lindsay, who stood nearest to them
in the regent's battle, said 'Let them go! I shall fill their
place better:' and so, stepping forward, with a company
of fresh men, charged the enemy, whose spears were now
spent, with long weapons, so that they were driven back
by force, being before almost overthrown by the avaunt-guard
and harquebusiers, and so were turned to flight."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Calderwood's</span>
<i>MS.</i> <i>apud</i> <span class="smcap">Keith</span>, p. 480. Melville mentions the flight
of the vanguard, but states it to have been commanded by
Morton, and composed chiefly of commoners of the barony of
Renfrew.</p>

<p>Lord Lindsay, of the Byres, was the most ferocious and
brutal of the regent's faction, and, as such, was employed to
extort Mary's signature to the deed of resignation, presented to
her in Lochleven castle. He discharged his commission with
the most savage rigour; and it is even said, that when the weeping
captive, in the act of signing, averted her eyes from the
fatal deed, he pinched her arm with the grasp of his iron glove.</p>

<p>Not only had the regent notice of the intended attempt upon
his life, but even of the very house from which it was threatened.&mdash;With

<h3><a name="THE_GRAY_BROTHER" id="THE_GRAY_BROTHER">THE GRAY BROTHER,</a></h3>

<p class="center">A FRAGMENT.</p>

<p class="center">NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED.&mdash;WALTER SCOTT.</p>


<hr class="tb" />

<p>The imperfect state of this ballad, which was written
several years ago, is not a circumstance affected for the
purpose of giving it that peculiar interest, which is often
found to arise from ungratified curiosity. On the contrary,
it was the editor's intention to have completed the
tale, if he had found himself able to succeed to his own
satisfaction. Yielding to the opinion of persons, whose
judgment, if not biassed by the partiality of friendship,
is entitled to deference, the editor has preferred inserting
these verses, as a fragment, to his intention of entirely
suppressing them.</p>

<p>The tradition, upon which the tale is founded, regards
a house, upon the barony of Gilmerton, near Laswade,
in Mid-Lothian. This building, now called Gilmerton
Grange, was originally named Burndale, from the following
tragic adventure. The barony of Gilmerton belonged,
of yore, to a gentleman, named Heron, who had one beautiful
daughter. This yo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>ung lady was seduced by the abbot
of Newbottle, a richly endowed abbey, upon the
banks of the south Esk, now a seat of the marquis of Lothian.
Heron came to the knowledge of this circumstance,
and learned also, that the lovers carried on their
guilty intercourse by the connivance of the lady's nurse,
who lived at this house of Gilmerton Grange, or Burndale.
He formed a resolution of bloody vengeance, undeterred
by the supposed sanctity of the clerical character,
or by the stronger claims of natural affection. Chusing,
therefore, a dark and windy night, when the objects of his
vengeance were engaged in a stolen interview, he set fire
to a stack of dried thorns, and other combustibles, which
he had caused to be piled against the house, and reduced
to a pile of glowing ashes the dwelling, with all its inmates.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>The scene, with which the ballad opens, was suggested
by the following curious passage, extracted from the life
of Alexander Peden, one of the wandering and persecuted
teachers of the sect of Cameronians, during the reign of
Charles II. and his successor, James. This person was
supposed by his followers, and, perhaps, really believed
himself, to be possessed of supernatural gifts; for the wild
scenes, which they frequented, and the constant dangers,
which were incurred through their proscription, deepened
upon their minds the gloom of superstition, so general in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>that age.</p>

<p>"About the same time he (Peden) came to Andrew
Normand's house, in the parish of Alloway, in the shire
of Ayr, being to preach at night in his barn. After he
came in, he halted a little, leaning upon a chair-back,
with his face covered; when he lifted up his head, he
said, 'There are in this house that I have not one word
of salvation unto;' he halted a little again, saying, 'This
is strange, that the devil will not go out, that we may
begin our work!' Then there was a woman went out, ill-looked
upon almost all her life, and to her dying hour,
for a witch, with many presumptions of the same. It
escaped me, in the former passages, that John Muirhead
(whom I have often mentioned) told me, that when he
came from Ireland to Galloway, he was at family-worship,
and giving some notes upon the Scripture, when a
very ill-looking man came, and sate down within the
door, at the back of the <i>hallan</i> (partition of the cottage):
immediately he halted, and said, 'There is some
unhappy body just now come into this house. I charge
him to go out, and not stop my mouth!' The person
went out, and he <i>insisted</i> (went on), yet he saw him
neither come in nor go out."&mdash;<i>The Life and Prophecies
of Mr Alexander Peden, late Minister of the Gospel at New
Glenluce, in Galloway</i>, Part II. &sect; 26.</p>

to sit upon a large rocky fragment, called the Buckstane, and

<p>Melville Castle, the seat of the honourable Robert Dundas,

<p>The ruins of Roslin Castle, the baronial residence of the ancient
family of St Clair, the Gothic chapel, which is still in
beautiful preservation, with the romantic and woody dell in
which they are situated, belong to the Right Honourable the Earl
of Rosslyn, the representative of the former lords of Roslin.</p>

<p>The village and castle of Dalkeith belonged, of old, to the
famous Earl of Morton, but is now the residence of the noble
family of Buccleuch. The park extends along the Esk, which
is there joined by its sister stream, of the same name.</p>

<p>Hawthornden, the residence of the poet Drummond. A
house, of more modern date, is inclosed, as it were, by the
ruins of the ancient castle, and overhangs a tremendous precipice,
upon the banks of the Eske, perforated by winding caves,
which, in former times, formed a refuge to the oppressed patriots
of Scotland. Here Drummond received Ben Jonson,
who journeyed from London, on foot, in order to visit him.
The beauty of this striking scene has been much injured, of
late years, by the indiscriminate use of the axe. The traveller
now looks in vain for the leafy bower,</p>

<p>The following War-Song was written during the apprehension
of an invasion. The corps of volunteers, to which
it was addressed, was raised in 1797, consisting of gentlemen,
mounted and armed at their own expence. It still
subsists, as the Right Troop of the Royal Mid-Lothian Light
Cavalry, commanded by the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel
Du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>ndas. The noble and constitutional measure of
arming freemen in defence of their own rights, was no
where more successful than in Edinburgh, which furnished
a force of 3000 armed and disciplined volunteers, including
a Regiment of Cavalry, from the city and county, and two
Corps of Artillery, each capable of serving twelve guns.
To such a force, above all others, might, in similar circumstances,
be applied the exhortation of our ancient Galgacus:
"<i>Proinde ituri in aciem, et majores vestros et posteros

<p>The allusion is to the massacre of the Swiss guards, on the
fatal 10th August, 1792. It is painful, but not useless, to remark,
that the passive temper with which the Swiss regarded
the death of their bravest countrymen, mercilessly slaughtered
in discharge of their duty, encouraged and authorized the progressive
injustice, by which the Alps, once the seat of the most
virtuous and free people upon the continent, have, at length,
been converted into the citadel of a foreign and military despot.
A state degraded is half enslaved.</p>

<p>"Harden's castle was situated upon the very brink of a dark

meet the Borthwick. In the recess of this glen he is said to

<p>Melrose Abbey was reduced to its present ruinous state,
partly by the English barons in their hostile inroads, and partly
by John Knox and his followers. For a reason why its abbots
should be supposed to take an interest in the Buccleuch family,

<p>The hero of this ballad was a native of Eskdale, and contributed
not a little towards the raising his clan to that pre-eminence
which it long maintained amongst the Border thieves,
and which none indeed but the Elliots could dispute. He lived
at the Stubholm, immediately below the junction of the Wauchope
and the Esk; and there distinguished himself so much
by zeal and assiduity in his professional duties, that at length
he found it expedient to emigrate, his neighbours not having
learned from Sir John Falstaff, that "it is no sin for a man
to labour in his vocation." He afterwards became a celebrated
jester in the English court. In more modern times, he
might have found a court in which his virtues would have entitled
him to a higher station. He was dismissed in disgrace
in the year 1737, for his insolent wit, of which the following
may serve as a specimen. One day when Archbishop Laud
was just about to say grace before dinner, Archie begged permission
of the king to perform that office in his stead; and
having received it, said, "All <i>praise</i> to God, and little <i>Laud</i>
to the deil." The exploit detailed in this ballad has been
preserved, with many others of the same kind, by tradition,
and is at this time current in Eskdale.</p>

<p>There is no district wherein witches seem to have maintained
a more extensive, or more recent influence than in Eskdale.
It is not long since the system of brib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>ery, alluded to in the
next stanza, was carried on in that part of the country. The
rowan-tree, or mountain-ash, is well known to be a sure preservative
against the power of witchcraft.</p>
